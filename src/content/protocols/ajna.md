# Summary

The Ajna Protocol is a noncustodial, peer-to-pool, permissionless lending, borrowing and trading system that requires no governance or external price feeds to function. The protocol consists of pools with lenders and borrowers.

# Overview

## Chain

The Ajna Protocol is deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

> Chain score: L

## Upgradeability

The protocol is immutable and permissionless by design and no heightened permissions are granted by the protocol code.

> Upgradeability score: L

## Autonomy

The protocol relies on a price bucket mechanism managed by lenders and borrowers, negating the need for any oracles or external feeds.

> Autonomy score: L

## Exit Window

Ajna Protocol's contracts are fully immutable, no upgrades or changes can be made, removing the need for an exit window.

> Exit Window score: L

## Accessibility

Multiple user interfaces exist and are operated by independent actors ensuring access to the protocol and user funds even if an interface is shutdown or censors a user's transactions.

## Permission owners

None. Ajna Protocol is ownerless by design. Copies of the code can be deployed permissionlessly on compatible EVMs.

## Permissions

None. Ajna Protocol is permissionless by design.

## Dependencies

None. Ajna Protocol has no external dependencies. No oracles, no governance. Mechanism design is incentive-based.

## Exit Window

The protocol is completely immutable, thus no exit window is required ðŸŽ‰

Pools are isolated from each other so damage caused by a market failure or technical flaw in a specific collateral is isolated to the individual pool.

# Security Council

The protocol is completely immutable, thus no Security Council is required ðŸŽ‰
