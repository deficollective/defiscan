# Summary

The Sky protocol is a decentralised protocol developed around the USDS stablecoin. It is managed by Sky ecosystem governance. The Sky Protocol features Sky tokens (USDS, SKY, DAI, MKR), the Sky Savings Rate, Sky Token Rewards, Activation Token Rewards, and SkyLink.The Protocol was built from the core module of the Maker Protocol and replaces Maker.

# Overview

## Chain

The Sky protocol is deployed on Ethereum and Base. This review focuses on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

## Upgradeability

In the upgradability section & risk we address bytecode upgrades and parameter changes that are permissioned.

We wrote a section explaining the Upgradeability Risk in our framework here: See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#upgradability

For some practical guidance follow this steps. It will help you in writing a nice report:

1. Run the [permission scanner](https://github.com/deficollective/permission-scanner)
2. Fill in all the permissioned functions in the table (`## Permissions`)
   - Remember: Each function with a permission needs to be considered when determining the risk on Upgradability
3. Get a mechanistic and precise understanding of each permissioned function
4. Assess impact for each function, look out for
   - loss/blocking of user funds
   - loss of unclaimed yield
   - change expected behavior significantly (blacklisting/kyc/fees/...)
5. Write the impact column based on your understanding
   - A good tipp when writing the impact column below, think of least 2,3 sentences:
   1. First sentence: what it does technically, e.g "It assigns a new address to the owner variable"
   2. Second: what is the impact within the system, e.g "The owner is permissioned to raise fees"
   3. Third: Imagine faulty or malicious action, e.g "The malicious owner could raise fees to 100%, redirecting all future yield.
6. Summarise and abstract away technical details in this section here (`## Upgradeability`)

## Autonomy

See oracles used and the security.
Do we consider MKR = SKY? If not then Maker is definitely a dependency. YES

## Exit Window

The minimum delay between approval and execution of a governance proposal is 18 hours.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Sky has a main frontend at [sky.money](sky.money).

| LockstakeClipper                     | file                   | Changes contract parameters such as incentives, auction reset parameters, auction duration, price modules, recipient of DAI raised, and liquidation module. The contract can also be stopped in three levels: 1) new auction stopped. 2) new auction and redoes stopped. 3) new auction, redoes, and bids stopped. Malicious or wrong manipulation of those parameters can result in unsuable auctions, loss of user colalteral, loss of system funds. | DSPauseProxy (DAO), Dog, End, ClipperMom                                         |
