# Summary

Lido is a liquid-staking protocol.

# Ratings

## Chain

Lido is currently deployed on multiple chains. This review focuses on the
Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

[WIP]

Critical contracts are upgradeable: Lido, WithdrawalQueue, WithdrawalVault, AccountingOracle. Malicious updates could result in the loss of user funds.

Further: Governance contracts are also upgradeable.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

One dependency of Lido is the need for an oracle to report the state of the beacon chain to Lido's smart contracts on Ethereum. The beacon chain of Ethereum is responsible for creating new blocks and ensuring consensus. It is made of all the validators who take part in the system with their stake (Proof-of-Stake). The state of the beacon chain is not accessible from within Ethereum smart contract. This is why an `AccountingOracle` and `ExitBusOracle` are used to report on this data. Lido has a consensus committee made of 9 members who report daily on the state of the beacon chain, 5 of which are necessary for a consensus to be reached. The signers are announced and respect our security council requirements. If colluding, those members could report false data onchain, which could result in inflation or deflation of `stETH` and lead to loss of user funds by insolvency. (**TODO: double check this claim**)

The _Deposit Security Module_ is another committee critical to the functioning of Lido. The _Deposit Security Module_ is made of 6 Guardians (4 necessary for quorum) and handles the deposits linked to the creation of new validators for Lido. Each new validator requires 32 ETH and only the _Deposit Security Module_ is allowed to sign off on the deposit. This committee was introduced to counter a possible frontrunning attack by node operators to steal the depositted ETH. The attack and the chosen mitigation are explained in this [post](https://research.lido.fi/t/mitigations-for-deposit-front-running-vulnerability/1239) (solution d). In case of collusion between 4 members of the security module and the node operator, the ETH depositted into new validators could be stolen, which would lead to loss of user funds. The _Deposit Security Module_ does not meet our security council requirements and therefore represents a high risk dependency.

[WIP]: Uses Chainlink Price Feeds. Why? Fallbacks?

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

[WIP]

- LDO Aragon Voting / Aragon Agent: No timelock. 5 Days voting period (3 days to vote, 2 days to object).
- Easytrack delay. 72 hours
- Emergency: no delay to pause deposits / freeze Lido transfers

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Lido has a main frontend at [stake.lido.fi](https://stake.lido.fi). This UI is released on IPFS and there are
instructions in the [docs](https://docs.lido.fi/ipfs/about) to access the latest release using any IPFS gateway of choice.

In addition to that, it offers an extended list of [UI integration elements](https://ui.lido.fi/) to help others integrate interaction with the Lido contracts. Several third-party applications or wallets, such as Metamask, Argent, and Infinex use this integration to enable direct interaction with Lido. Those apps, in addition to IPFS, represent an acceptable backup solution to access the protocol.

> Accessibility score: Low

## Conclusion

[WIP]

Could reach Stage 1: Security council setup on deposit guardians and emergency brakes. Mitigated reliance on Chainlink.

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Reviewer Notes

[WIP] Considered curated node operators as insiders for now.

# Protocol Analysis

[WIP]

Staking module: contract that manages its own subset of validators.

StakingRouter: registry of staking modules. allocates stake to modules. distribute protocol fees
Modules can be active, paused (no more deposits, but rewards), stopped (no deposits, no rewards).

`DepositSecurityModule`: Guardians are involved in the making a deposit. DepositContract =>

There is a strategy (MinFirstAllocationStrategy) that chooses to which validator to distribute the stake too.

Fee is in two parts: module fee, treasury fee, in %

APMRegistry:

Simple DVT: handle the NO set?

# Governance

<-- DIAGRAM -->

The `Aragon Kernel` is the core contract in the Aragon framework, serving as the foundation for decentralized organizations (DAOs). It acts as both a registry for applications and the central permissions management system.

The `Aragon TokenManager` is an Aragon application that manages the `LDO` governance token, providing functionality for token distribution, vesting, and control.

The Finance contract is part of the Aragon OS ecosystem and serves as a financial controller for DAOs, including Lido. It manages:Treasury funds through a Vault. Period-based accounting. Scheduled and immediate payments. Budget controls for different tokens. Transaction recording and reporting

Easytrack: set of pre-approved governance operations that can be executed after some waiting period if there was no governance objection.

This report includes information on the number of Lido validators on the consensus layer, their cumulative balance, exited validators, balance of the rewards and withdrawal vaults, and the simulated share rate (total ether / all shares emitted). This information is then processed and transmitted to other Lido contracts. It will influence how shares are rebased and whether validators will be exited/created in future slots. The report of wrong data could therefore lead to the loss of unclaimed yield or loss of user funds. | HashConsensus (Committee Members)                                                               |

| Voting | unsafelyChangeVoteTime | Changes the total duration of voting. This affects all existing unexecuted votes. The new value has to be greater than the objection time and will effectively change the main voting period. The main voting period is the time before objection during which users can vote "yes" or "no" for proposals. If the new time is smaller than the passed time on existing proposals this would fast forward the proposals to the objection or closed phase. | ['auth'] |
| Voting | unsafelyChangeObjectionPhaseTime | Changes the duration of the objection phase. This affects all existing unexecuted votes and could be used to remove, fast forward, or exten the objection phase on existing and future proposals. The new value has to be less than the total vote time. | ['auth'] |

| TokenManager | assign | Assigns a given amount of `LDO` tokens to a recipient. The tokens are directly taken out of the `TokenManager` and transferred to the recipient. | ['arr', 'authP'] |
| TokenManager | assignVested | ASsigns a given of `LDO` tokens to a recipient with a specific vesting plan. The full amount is transferred to the address but the `LDO` token is trusted to call the `TokenManager` upon each transfer and enforce the vesting plan. The plan can optionally contain a revokable flag which allows the manager to cancel the remaining locked tokens in a plan at any time before the plan expires. | ['arr', 'authP'] |
| TokenManager | burn | Burns the given amount of `LDO` tokens of any given address. This allows this contract to burn any user's `LDO` tokens. | ['arr', 'authP'] |
| TokenManager | revokeVesting | Revokes a user's vesting plan. This will cancel all the tokens that are still locked. | ['arr', 'authP', 'vestingExists'] |
| TokenManager | forward | Runs an Aragon EVM script on behalf of a token holder. The token holder needs to have permission and the contract uses a blakclist to prevent the holder from executing actions on behalf of the `TokenManager`. | [] |
| Finance | newImmediatePayment | Makes a new instant payment of a given amount of tokens to a receiver. The tokens are taken out of the vault. The current vault is the `AragonAgent` | Aragon Voting, EasyTrack EVMSCriptExecutor |
| Finance | newScheduledPayment | Creates a new recurring payment. Recurring payments have a starting date, an intervale at which they can be executed, and a total amount of executions. The intervals are fixed and in reference to the starting timestamp, the payment can be manually executed once per interval. It may also be executed late. | Aragon Voting, EasyTrack EVMSCriptExecutor |
| Finance | setPeriodDuration | Sets the accounting period duration. The period is used for accounting and budget restrictions. The new duration will be effective from the next period. | TODO: ACL permission manager? |
| Finance | setBudget | Sets the spending budget of a given token for per accounting period. This budget is enforced for each payment and resets at the end of the accounting period. | TODO: ACL permission manager? |
| Finance | removeBudget | Removes the budget for a token and enables unlimited spending. | TODO: ACL permission manager? |
| Finance | executePayment | Executes a schedule payment as many times as possible according to the current timestamp and payment limit. | Aragon Voting |
| Finance | receiverExecutePayment | Similar to `executePayment`but can be called by the payment's receiver. | payment recipient |
| Finance | setPaymentStatus | Sets the status of a scheduled payment as active or inactive. When inactive the payment can no longer be triggered. If reactivated the missed payment intervals can still be triggered in retrospect. | Aragon Voting |

| Repo | newVersion | Updates the version for the tracked package. Each version is specified by a version number (major.minimal.patch), a content URI and the corresponding contract address. The contract address can only be changed if the major version number if changed. | ['auth']|

| APMRegistry | newRepo | Creates a new `Repo` contract for on-chain version control. Grants version management permissions to a an address specified by the caller. | ['auth'] |
| APMRegistry | newRepoWithVersion | Similar to `newRepo` with the initial version specified. | ['auth'] |

|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | add_relay | Adds a relay to the list of approved relays in MEV-Boost setups. The relays listed in the contract are used to generate a configuration file to be used by the node operators. | Relay Maintenance Committee, Aragon Agent |
|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | remove_relay | Removes a relay from the list. | Relay Maintenance Committee, Aragon Agent |
|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | change_owner | Changes the contract owner. The owner can name a manager, add or remove relays, and recover funds from the contract. The current owner is the Lido DAO.| Aragon Agent |
|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | set_manager | Sets a manager who can add or remove relays. | Aragon Agent |
|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | dismiss_manager | Dismisses the current manager and sets the manager to the zero address. | Aragon Agent |
|MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (Vyper) | recover_erc20 | Transfers ERC20 tokens out of the contract and to any non-zero address. This is meant to recover funds sent to the contract by mistake. | Aragon Agent |
| EasyTrack | addEVMScriptFactory | Adds a script factory to the contract and associated permissions. This factory can later be used by anyone to create motions in the easy track. The factory can only create script which execute functions allowed by the specified permissions. | Aragon Voting |
| EasyTrack | removeEVMScriptFactory | Removes a script factory from the contract and prevents any further motions to be created from it. | Aragon Voting |
| EasyTrack | setEVMScriptExecutor | Sets the script executor, the contract used to execute the motions. | Aragon Voting |
| EasyTrack | setMotionDuration | Sets the duration of a motion. This is a critical parameter as it represents the minimal waiting time before a motion can be enacted. If the time is too short users will not have time to object to the motion and cancel it. A duration cannot be set to less than 48 hours and is currently 72 hours at the time of writing. | Aragon Voting|
| EasyTrack | setObjectionsThreshold | Sets the percent of total governance tokens required to object to a motion, in basis points (1% = 100). The current objection threshold is 0.5% of all governance tokens. | Aragon Voting |
| EasyTrack | setMotionsCountLimit | Sets a limit for the number of motions which can be ongoing at all times. | Aragon Voting |
| EasyTrack | cancelMotion | Allows the creator of a motion to cancel it before execution. | Motion Creator |
