# Summary

_Lido V2_ is a liquid-staking protocol. Liquid staking allows users to deposit `ETH` for staking to a set
of _Node Operators_ who run validators with `ETH` staked in Lido. In exchange for depositing `ETH` users get `stETH`, _Liquid staked Ether_, a token issued by Lido which represents the staked `ETH`. This token can then be used throughout DeFi in other protocols, for example, as collateral. Lido takes a 10% fee on the yield, split between the _Lido Treasury_ and _Node Operators_.

_Lido V2_ uses a system of _Staking Modules_ as explained in the [Protocol Analysis](#protocol-analysis). Each _Staking Module_ has its own set of _Node Operators_, incentive mechanisms, and potential penalties. Currently three modules exist: the _Curated_, _Simple-DVT_, and _Community_ staking modules. Validators in the first two have to be approved by _Lido Governance_, whereas anyone can become a _Node Operator_ for the _Community Staking Module_ by depositing a bond.

# Ratings

## Chain

Lido is currently deployed on multiple chains. This review focuses on the
Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

Most contracts in the Lido protocol can be upgraded. In particular, this includes the deposit, withdrawal and rewards contracts through which `ETH` deposits and withdrawals are processed and staking yield is distributed. Upgrading those contracts can lead to the _loss of funds_ or _unclaimed yield_ for Lido users.

The staking module contracts `NodeOperatorsRegistry` and `CSModule` are also upgradeable. Those contracts are responsible for tracking the _Node Operators_. Upgrading these contracts may lead to the _loss of funds_ for _Node Operators_ or users (to the benefit of _Node Operators_).

Furthermore, the governance contracts `Voting` and `Agent` can also be upgraded, with the potential impact of replacing the current implementation of the _Lido Governance_ permissions and processes.

Finally, the [Consensus Committee](#security-council) is in control of reporting on the state of the beacon chain through the `AccountingOracle` and `ExitBusOracle` contracts. If compromised, it could manipulate the `stETH` supply through false data reporting, leading to inflation or deflation of `stETH`. Similarly, the guardians of the [Deposit Security Module](#security-council) control the creation of new Lido validators and, if colluding with _Node Operators_, could enable theft of deposited `ETH`. Both these centralization vectors can thus result in the _loss of funds_ for users.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

Lido relies on _Node Operators_ to operate the validators. As explained in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis), users' staked funds are not in control by the _Node Operators_. This is because Lido enforces that these funds can only be withdrawn to a fixed withdrawal account, that is controled by the Lido protocol. Nonetheless, the _Node Operators_ may misbehave and lose funds due to slashing. In addition to that, _Node Operators_ could steal parts of the earned staking yield, by redirecting them to their own address. In the worst case, a validator can lose up to 16 `ETH` to slashing events before it is forcefully exited and the remaining `ETH` withdrawn to Lido's withdrawal account.

Lido addresses those risks differently for each staking module. In the _Curated Module_, the _Node Operators_ are trusted and approved by _Lido Governance_. Currently 36 _Node Operators_ exist which manage on average 7'779 validators each. Different diversification measures are implemented to mitigate the risk of centralized infrastructure. This is detailed on a dedicated [dashboard](https://app.hex.tech/8dedcd99-17f4-49d8-944e-4857a355b90a/app/3f7d6967-3ef6-4e69-8f7b-d02d903f045b/latest). We computed that in a worst-case scenario, the failure of a _Node Operator_ in the _Curated Module_ would impact less than 1% of the total funds staked through Lido (see more in [dependencies](#dependencies)).

In the _Community Module_, anyone can become a _Node Operator_, but needs to deposit a bond of up to 2.4 `ETH` for the first validator or 1.3 `ETH` for all additional validators. Funds lost by the _Node Operators_ in the _Community Module_, eg due to slashing or theft of staking yield, are compensated through this bond and additional penalties for the _Node Operators_ applied on top. Currently 312 _Node Operators_ are active in the _Community Module_ with an average of 19 validators operated by each. Additional losses, that exceed the _Node Operator's_ deposited bond, are covered by the _Lido Treasury_.

> Autonomy score: Low

## Exit Window

_Lido Governance_ is an onchain governance system that allows `LDO` holders to vote on contract upgrades and other governance matters. The voting period is made of 5 days, only the first 3 of which can be used to approve a proposal, with 2 additional days to object to an accepted proposal. No _Exit Window_ is enforced once the voting period has ended.

A system of `Easytrack` is in place for a set of pre-approved actions to be executed without requiring a quorum. Actions in the `Easytrack` contract have a 3-day delay which can be vetoed with more than 0.5% of the voting power. Different multisigs can create `Easytrack` actions which may make treasury payments, control the _Simple-DVT Module_, or settle penalties in the _Community Module_. The [Simple-DVT Module Committee](#security-council) has the permission to create `Easytrack` actions for the _Simple-DVT Module_, these actions include the approval of new _Node Operators_ on the _Simple-DVT Module_ and thus potentially impact user funds. The [Simple-DVT Module Committee](#security-council) complies with the _Security Council_ requirements, thus mitigating the respective risks. The `Easytrack` can be paused by the [Emergency Brakes](#security-council) multisig or by _Lido Governance_.

Finally, there exist multiple _Emergency Actions_ which can be initiated by different Lido multisig accounts. Any signer in the `DepositSecurityModule` can trigger the pause of all deposits without delay. In addition to that, the _Community Staking Module_ can be completely paused by the [Community Staking Module Committee](#security-council), this includes the registering of new _Node Operators_ and claiming rewards.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Lido has a main frontend at [stake.lido.fi](https://stake.lido.fi). The different releases of this frontend are published on IPFS and instructions to access the latest release using an IPFS gateway of choice are available on the public [docs](https://docs.lido.fi/ipfs/about).

In addition to that, multiple third-party frontends, applications and wallets, such as Metamask, Argent, and Infinex, exist and enable direct access to the Lido protocol. In fact, Lido offers a public library of [UI integration elements](https://ui.lido.fi/) that enables third parties to seamlessly build more frontends to Lido.

> Accessibility score: Low

## Conclusion

Lido receives a _High Centralization_ score in terms of _Upgradeability_ and _Exit Window_. This is due to its contracts allowing for critical upgrades that are not protected with a sufficient _Exit Window_. Furthermore, its [DepositSecurityModule](#security-council) multisig exposes critical permissions without meeting the Security Council requirements. For these reasons, Lido achieves **Stage 0**.

Lido could reach _Stage 1_ by enforcing a _7-day Exit Window_ to the critical smart contract upgrades or any action that may result in the _loss of user funds_ or adopting a _Security Council_ to safeguard those actions. It would also need to update the [DepositSecurityModule](#security-council) to a _Security Council_.

Lido could reach _Stage 2_ by implementing a 30-day _Exit Window_ and replacing the [Consensus Committee](#security-council) and [DepositSecurityModule](#security-council) through sufficiently decentralizated solutions.

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Protocol Analysis

## Liquid Stakings

An overview of Lido's liquid staking protocol can be seen below.

![Overview of Lido](./diagrams/lido-overview.png)

Users can stake their `ETH` with Lido through the `Lido` contract and obtain `stETH` in return. Users can then redeem their `stETH` for `ETH` by entering a withdrawal queue in interacting directly with the `WithdrawalQueueuErc721`. The deposits and withdrawals may balance each other, but when excess `ETH` is deposited or more `stETH` is redeemed, Ethereum validators operated by different _Node Operators_ are created or asked to exit.

A [Consensus Committee](#security-council) is trusted to report the relevant state of the consensus layer onchain. The report includes information on the number of Lido validators on the consensus layer, their cumulative balance, exited validators, the balance of the rewards and withdrawal vaults, and the simulated share rate (total `ETH` per share emitted). This information is then processed and transmitted to other Lido contracts. It will influence how shares are rebased and whether validators may be created or asked to exit in future slots. The report of wrong data could therefore lead to the _loss of unclaimed yield_ or _loss of user funds_. This makes the [Consensus Committee](#security-council) a critical dependency.

The governance contract `Voting` and its `Agent` have managing rights on all apps and ossifiable proxies respectively. This includes contract upgrades.

### Validator creation

When enough `ETH` is deposited into the contract, the `StakingRouter` chooses a pair of validator keys from either the _Curated_, _Simple-DVT_, or _Community_ staking modules to assign funds to, following a specific algorithm and the governance chosen allocation. An offchain set of 6 guardians form the `DepositSecurityModule`. They coordinate to sign the Merkle root of the deposit contract and trigger the deposit of 32 `ETH` for the chosen validator keys. The guardians have been introduced to counter a [frontrunning vulnerability from validators](https://research.lido.fi/t/mitigations-for-deposit-front-running-vulnerability/1239) and ensure the validators' withdrawal address is the Lido `WithdrawalsManagerProxy`.

### Validator exit

Validators may be asked to exit to provide `ETH` to the withdrawal queue. The signal to exit will be sent during one of the oracle reports, the oracles should then withdraw all 32 `ETH` staked. Those funds are sent automatically to the `WithdrawalsManagerProxy`. If validators are not exited they are declared _stuck_ and the _Node Operators_ will be penalized.

### Staking Rewards

Validator rewards come from two sources: the consensus and execution layers. The consensus layer rewards come from the validators' participation in the consensus and are automatically distributed to the validators' withdrawal address. This address has to be the same for all Lido validators and is set to the `WithdrawalsManagerProxy`. Execution layer rewards include MEV and are not fixed. The _Node Operators_ are trusted to send those rewards to the `LidoExecutionLayerRewardsVault`and are penalized if they fail to do so.

Both types of rewards are combined and distributed to all `stETH` holders after a 10% fee split between the treasury and the staking modules (_Node Operators_). The specific fee allocation between treasury and module differs for each staking module.

## Staking Modules

Lido allocates funds to different staking modules that handle their own set of _Node Operators_ and incentive mechanisms. Each new module is approved through governance proposals and 3 modules are currently deployed: the _Curated_, _Simple-DVT_, and _Community_ staking modules. We detail each of those below.

### Curated and Simple-DVT Staking Modules

The _Curated Module_ is the original staking module for Lido. It is made of professional _Node Operators_ who have been approved by the governance. At the time of writing more than 95% of Lido validators are operated by the _Curated_ staking module.

The _Simple-DVT Module_ is an experimenting module to develop _Distributed Validator Technologies_ and operates with implementations from both [Obol](https://obol.tech/) and [SSV Network](https://ssv.network/). New _Node Operators_ are approved by governance through the `Easytrack` process, which is explained in the [Governance section](#governance).

Both of those modules are represented onchain by the contracts using the same implementation of the `NodeOperatorsRegistry` which simply stores information on the registered _Node Operators_, their validator keys, and potential penalties. The _Curated_ module's registry is solely managed by the governance's `Agent`, while the _Simple-DVT_ can additionally be managed through [Easytrack](#governance) by the [Simple-DVT Module Committee](#security-council), but upgraded by the `Agent` only.

### Community Staking Module

An overview of the _Community Staking Module_ can be seen below.

![Overview of Lido's Community Staking Module](./diagrams/lido-csm.png)

The _Community Staking Module_ (CSM) is a permissionless module. _Node Operators_ can register themselves into the module by paying a bond per pair of validator keys added. _Node Operators_ interact with the `CSModule` contract which deposits data and interacts with the `StakingRouter`. An additional `CSAccounting` is responsible for the management of bonds, rewards, and penalties. The bonding curve used to determine bond prices can also be updated through this contract. The `CSEarlyAdoption` contract keeps track of early adopters who have lower bond prices.

Finally, `CSFeeDistributor` handles the distribution of rewards to _Node Operators_. It receives the non-distributed rewards from the `CSModule` every time the `StakingRouter` mints additional _Node Operator_ rewards. It accepts calls from `CSAccounting` with reward claims and stores the balances of claims from each _Node Operator_ as well as the late Merkle proof of the rewards distribution Merkle tree. It receives this root from the [Consensus Committee](#security-council) through the `CSOracle`.

Those contracts are upgradeable by the governance through the `Agent` contract. The `Agent` also holds the right to change the exit charge, which could abuse the _Node Operators_' deposited bonds. The [Community Staking Module Committee](#security-council) can also report reward stealing from _Node Operators_ in order to penalize them. The committee may also pause the staking module at any time, prohibiting _Node Operators_ from claiming their rewards until it is resumed by the governance.

# Dependencies

Lido relies on _Node Operators_ to operate the validators. The funds are not in the control of the _Node Operators_ and will be returned to Lido in case of withdrawal. Nonetheless, the NodeOperators may misbehave and lose some of the funds due to slashing.

Lido addresses this issue differently for each staking module. This is explained in the respective staking modules' subsections of the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis).

We focus the analysis on the _Curated Node Operators_ since they operate 94% of the Lido validators and have the most centralization. The _Curated Node Operators_ have different diversification measures to mitigate the risk of bugs or infrastructure failures. This is detailed on a dedicated [dashboard](https://app.hex.tech/8dedcd99-17f4-49d8-944e-4857a355b90a/app/3f7d6967-3ef6-4e69-8f7b-d02d903f045b/latest). In the worst case of a _Curated Node Operator_ getting slashed on all his validators, this would result in a loss of 1.8 ETH per validator, assuming a non-Ethereum-wide adversarial coordination. On the other hand, if all validators of a given _Curated Node Operator_ go down and all keys are lost due to infrastructure issues, those validators would lose 15.8% of their funds annually due to inactivity penalties down to 16.75 ETH (as detailed in [[1](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/82067/is-there-a-penalty-for-having-a-eth-2-0-staking-node-go-down)], [[2](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/incentives/inactivity/#:~:text=The%20inactivity%20penalty%20is%20applied,this%20is%20a%20no%2Dop.)]), assuming no ["non-activity" leak phase](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/incentives/inactivity/#:~:text=The%20inactivity%20penalty%20is%20applied,this%20is%20a%20no%2Dop.). Once it reaches 16.75 ETH the remaining balance is automatically withdrawn. In such instance and taking the current Lido statistics, 2.65% of the funds would become inaccessible, with 1.26% being definitely lost overtime and the remaining being frozen for a long period.

In both cases, this would impact less than 3% of the funds locked in the Lido protocol.

The operators in the _Simple-DVT_ and _Community_ modules represent the same risk of potential losses per validator, but those are less impactful due to; a greater diversification of _Node Operators_ in the case of the the _Simple-DVT_ module, and the security bond deposited by operators in the _Community_ module.

# Governance

![Overview of Lido's Governance](./diagrams/lido-dao.png)

Lido uses _Aragon_ for its governance model. _Aragon_ has _Apps_ which are referred to by namespace and app ID. The `Kernel` app is the core contract in the _Aragon_ framework. It acts as both a registry for applications and the central permissions management reference. The `Kernel` forwards all permission checks to the `ACL` which stores all the access control conditions for _Lido Aragon Apps_ All the _Aragon Apps_ currently used for the _Lido Governance_ are upgradeable.

The `Voting` app is the main governance entry point in which users can vote and create proposals. Proposals that interact with _Aragon Apps_ (`AppProxy` contracts) are executed through `Voting` while proposals interacting with other contracts such as `OssifiableProxy` are executed through the `Agent`.

The `TokenManager` is an Aragon application that manages the `LDO` governance token, providing functionality for token distribution, vesting, and control. The `Finance` contract serves as a financial controller. It manages treasury funds through a Vault and handles recurring as well as one-time payments.

An `Easytrack` handles a set of pre-approved governance operations that can be executed after a waiting period if there is no governance objection. The _Factories_ through which operations can be created are created by the governance and only a _trusted caller_ can create the operations. For operations on the _Simple-DVT_ and _Community_ modules, only their respective [committees](#security-council) can create motions. Once a motion is created it can be cancelled by 0.5% of the voting power during the 3-day delay. In addition to managing the staking modules, the `EasyTrack` is also used for treasury payments through the `Finance` contract. A variety of multisigs is allowed to make different payments through the `EasyTrack`, the complete list is
documented by Lido [here](https://docs.lido.fi/multisigs/committees#21-lego-committee).

## Exit Window

The voting period on _Lido Governance_ proposals is made of 5 days, only the first 3 of which can be used to approve a proposal, with 2 additional days to object to an accepted proposal. Once the voting period ends there are no delays before the proposal can be executed. Anyone can create a proposal, but it is only valid if at least 5% of the total `LDO` tokens are used to vote for one of the options. The proposal passes if more than 50% of the votes are in favor.

This is the reaction time allowed for guardians to pause deposits. When a guardian wants to pause deposits it specifies a block number, the pause is only applied if the current block number is within the validity period of the specified block. This is to avoid replay of pause messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Agent                                                                                        |

This report includes information on the number of Lido validators on the consensus layer, their cumulative balance, exited validators, balance of the rewards and withdrawal vaults, and the simulated share rate (total ether / all shares emitted). This information is then processed and transmitted to other Lido contracts. It will influence how shares are rebased and whether validators will be exited/created in future slots. The report of wrong data could therefore lead to the loss of unclaimed yield or loss of user funds. | HashConsensus (Committee Members)                                                            |
