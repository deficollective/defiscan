# Summary

Chronicle Labs is an oracle protocol that computes a median price from multiple sources. The protocol contains validators who push new prices and challengers who enforce cryptographic verification. Becoming a validator is a permissioned process; a majority of the validators in place are held by third-party entities in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The validators in the protocols are hosted by various third parties such as (but not limited to) Nethermind, Gnosis, Bitcoin Suisse, DeFi Saver, ETHGlobal, Gitcoin, and Etherscan. About 11 validators are listed without officially representing an entity (address only), out of 25 total. The validators collaborate in a peer-to-peer fashion, and the final signature is pushed onchain and verifiable.

Each price feed (oracle) is its own smart contract, which holds the corresponding validator set. A `ValidatorRegistry_2` exists to be used as a certificate authority and proves that each validator knows the private key to their claimed public key.

# Protocol Analysis

An overview of the Chronicle protocol can be seen below.

![Overview of Chronicle](./diagrams/chronicle-overview.png)

The core of the protocol is the oracle contracts, the validators, and the `ValidatorRegistry_2`.

Each oracle has its own validator set (a subset of all the validators). This set can be changed by a `TimelockController`, which is owned by the [Chronicle multisig](#security-council). A `Kisser` contract holds similar admin permissions over the oracles but is, by design, restricted to only being able to add new customers.

There is a single `TimelockController` per chain with admin permissions on all oracles. The delay is therefore the same for each oracle: 7 days. According to the documentation (but not strictly verified), the same delay is enforced on each chain where Chronicle is deployed.

The `ValidatorRegistry_2` does _not_ directly affect the validators whitelisted (_lifted_) on the oracles. It is used to publicly prove that each validator knows the private key to their claimed public key. This prevents rogue key attacks in which a validator claims their public key is the sum of other public keys and thereby signs for multiple other validators at once.

# Rating

As mentioned in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis), the [Chronicle multisig](#security-council) has permissions to change each oracle's validator set. Changing the validator set could put the system at risk of controlled prices, which could lead to the loss of user funds in protocols that rely on ChronicleLabs' oracles. Any changes in an oracle's validator set are subject to a **7-day exit window**.

Finally, 3 _Externally Owned Accounts_ (EOAs) can add or remove validator public keys to the `ValidatorRegistry_2` without delay. Updating the registry in a malicious fashion does not weaken the assumptions on the possibility of price manipulation, as the validators perform all cryptographic actions based on the oracle contracts. Update or addition of a public key in the registry must come with a valid signature. The registry only improves the guarantees of the protocol by attesting that each validator owns their key, and this key is a single key (not a sum of keys). Moreover, it allows potential DoS mitigations on the peer-to-peer network by filtering messages based on recovered signers.

Oracles and validators are listed on ChronicleLabs' [public dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard). This allows anyone to verify the data cryptographically. The dashboard is not open-source, but this does not prevent the monitoring of the onchain activity from the side of projects using ChronicleLabs' oracles.

## Conclusion

ChronicleLabs' protocol exposes centralized permissions on the oracles' validator set, which are protected with a 7-day _Exit Window_. The protocol relies on third-party entities that collaborate offchain in a peer-to-peer fashion to produce a verifiable price onchain. The global list of validators contains 25 entities, including 14 publicly known in the Ethereum ecosystem. This results in a _Medium_ Centralization score.

> Overall score: Medium

# Reviewer Notes

This review is limited to Chornicle Oracles deployed on Ethereum mainnet. We note that the findings should generalize to all chains according to Chronicle's documentation.

## Security Council

The multisig in charge of the `TimelockController` is a 2/3 multisig belonging to chronicle. It does not meet our security council requirements.
