# Summary

PancakeSwap V3 is an automated market maker (AMM) on BNB Smart Chain with concentrated liquidity functionality. Unlike PancakeSwap V2's uniform liquidity distribution, V3 allows liquidity providers to deploy capital within specific price ranges. The protocol implements multiple fee tiers (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%), represents LP positions as NFTs instead of fungible tokens, and distributes CAKE token incentives only to liquidity positions that are in-range.

# Overview

## Chain

PancakeSwap V3 is deployed on multiple blockchains. This review focuses on its BNB Smart Chain (BSC) deployment, which uses a Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus with 45 active validators.

While L2beat's "stages" framework is commonly used to evaluate Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, it's not applicable to BSC as an independent blockchain. Unlike L2s, BSC maintains its own security model without inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees. The PoSA consensus centralizes influence among major BNB holders, with Binance playing a significant governance role. The network's fault tolerance allows up to one-third of validators to act maliciously before security is compromised.

## Upgradeability

In the upgradability section & risk we address bytecode upgrades and parameter changes that are permissioned.

We wrote a section explaining the Upgradeability Risk in our framework here: See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#upgradability

For some practical guidance follow this steps. It will help you in writing a nice report:

1. Run the [permission scanner](https://github.com/deficollective/permission-scanner)
2. Fill in all the permissioned functions in the table (`## Permissions`)
   - Remember: Each function with a permission needs to be considered when determining the risk on Upgradability
3. Get a mechanistic and precise understanding of each permissioned function
4. Assess impact for each function, look out for
   - loss/blocking of user funds
   - loss of unclaimed yield
   - change expected behavior significantly (blacklisting/kyc/fees/...)
5. Write the impact column based on your understanding
   - A good tipp when writing the impact column below, think of least 2,3 sentences:
   1. First sentence: what it does technically, e.g "It assigns a new address to the owner variable"
   2. Second: what is the impact within the system, e.g "The owner is permissioned to raise fees"
   3. Third: Imagine faulty or malicious action, e.g "The malicious owner could raise fees to 100%, redirecting all future yield.
6. Summarise and abstract away technical details in this section here (`## Upgradeability`)

| PancakeV3Factory             | setOwner                      | This function transfers complete control of the factory to a new address, replacing the current owner. The owner controls all administrative functions including fee management, revenue collection, and pool deployment. A transfer to a malicious address would give total control over all critical protocol functions.                                                                                                                                                                            | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | enableFeeAmount               | This function permanently adds a new fee tier with an associated tick spacing to the protocol. Once added, a fee tier's existence cannot be removed from the system, but its activation state can be modified. The fee is limited by code to a maximum of 99.9999% (require(fee < 1000000)).                                                                                                                                                                                                          | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | setWhiteListAddress           | This function modifies an address's status in the whitelist authorized to create pools. The owner can restrict pool creation for fee tiers with whitelistRequested=true to only approved addresses. This restriction limits access to new pool creation for non-whitelisted users without affecting existing pools.                                                                                                                                                                                   | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | setFeeAmountExtraInfo         | This function modifies the activation state and whitelist requirement of an existing fee tier. Setting a fee tier to disabled (enabled=false) prevents it from being used for new pool creation, while still preserving its entry in the system. If all existing fee tiers were disabled, creation of any new pools would be temporarily impossible until at least one tier is re-enabled.                                                                                                            | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | setLmPoolDeployer             | This function sets the address that, in addition to the owner, is authorized to call setLmPool. A change to this address modifies who can establish associations between exchange pools and reward pools. An incorrect address would prevent configuration of new farming pools, affecting only the incentive distribution system.                                                                                                                                                                    | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | setFeeProtocol                | This function configures the percentage of exchange fees redirected to the protocol for a specific pool. Accepted values are between 0% (disabled) and 40% (value 4000), with a granularity of 0.01%. At maximum (40%), this function reduces liquidity providers' revenue by 40% in the targeted pool.                                                                                                                                                                                               | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | collectProtocol               | This function withdraws accumulated protocol fees from a specific pool to a recipient address. It transfers the exact token amounts collected during exchange activities. These funds can be sent to any address specified by the caller, with no restriction on the destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)                               |
| PancakeV3Factory             | setLmPool                     | This function associates a farming pool with an existing exchange pool by calling setLmPool on the pool contract. It registers the address where liquidity providers can stake their position NFTs to earn CAKE rewards. An incorrect address would prevent access to farming rewards for that specific pool only.                                                                                                                                                                                    | PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy) or PancakeV3LmPoolDeployer    |
| PancakeV3PoolDeployer        | deploy                        | This function creates a new PancakeV3Pool contract with the specified parameters (tokens, fee, tickSpacing). It can only be called by the factory address that was set during initialization. The deployment uses create2 with a deterministic salt based on the tokens and fee, ensuring predictable pool addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                 | PancakeV3Factory                                      |
| PancakeV3Pool (example pool) | setFeeProtocol                | This function configures the protocol fee percentage for both tokens in a pool. The values must be either 0 (no protocol fee) or between 1000 (10%) and 4000 (40%). When set to a non-zero value, the specified percentage of all swap fees will be directed to the protocol instead of liquidity providers. This affects the economics of the pool by redistributing a portion of fees from LPs to the protocol treasury.                                                                            | PancakeV3Factory or PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)           |
| PancakeV3Pool (example pool) | collectProtocol               | This function allows withdrawal of accumulated protocol fees from the pool to a specified recipient address. It can collect any amount up to the total accumulated fees for each token. This represents the actual extraction of value that was redirected from LPs to the protocol via the protocol fee setting.                                                                                                                                                                                     | PancakeV3Factory or PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)           |
| PancakeV3Pool (example pool) | setLmPool                     | This function sets the address of the liquidity mining pool contract that will be called during swap operations to manage liquidity mining rewards. Once set, the pool will interact with this contract to distribute rewards to liquidity providers based on their participation. This integration enables the incentivization mechanism for liquidity providers.                                                                                                                                    | PancakeV3Factory or PCSV3FeeHandler (Proxy)           |
| SmartRouter                  | setStableSwap                 | This function modifies the stableSwapFactory and stableSwapInfo addresses within the SmartRouter contract. The stableSwapFactory address determines which pools are considered valid stable pools, while the stableSwapInfo address performs exchange rate calculations for trades. Malicious implementations of these contracts redirect user transactions to fraudulent pools and manipulate exchange rates, resulting in direct loss of user funds through unfavorable trades.                     | unknown address 1                                       |
| SmartRouter                  | transferOwnership             | This function allows the current owner to transfer complete control of the contract to a new address. Such action would give full control over the contract and its restricted functions to the new address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | unknown address 1                                        |
| SmartRouter                  | renounceOwnership             | This function allows the owner to renounce ownership of the contract, making restricted functions permanently inaccessible. Once ownership is renounced, administrative features cannot be recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | unknown address 1                                        |
| MasterChefV3                 | setEmergency                  | This function sets the boolean variable emergency to true or false. When emergency is true, the harvestOperation function will not accumulate new CAKE rewards and the withdraw function will not update positions in LM pools. Users retain the ability to withdraw their tokens and claim rewards accumulated before the emergency state was activated.                                                                                                                                             | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | setReceiver                   | This function updates the receiver address variable which is the only address authorized to call the upkeep function. The upkeep function is responsible for transferring CAKE tokens from the receiver to the contract and setting the reward distribution parameters. A change to this address modifies the source of CAKE tokens for the reward system.                                                                                                                                            | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | setLMPoolDeployer             | This function changes the address that deploys new LM pool contracts when adding V3 pools to the farming system. It only affects future pools, not existing ones. A malicious deployer could create compromised LM pools that manipulate reward calculations, divert funds during position updates, or contain backdoors to manipulate position states.                                                                                                                                               | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | add                           | This function registers a new V3 pool for farming rewards, deploys its associated LMPool contract, and assigns allocation points that directly determine its share of CAKE rewards. Through this function, the owner selects which token pairs receive rewards and determines their exact reward allocation, creating direct economic incentives for liquidity provision in selected pools.                                                                                                           | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | set                           | This function modifies the allocation points of an existing pool, which mathematically alters the percentage of total CAKE rewards it receives (allocation/totalAllocation). The owner can drastically change reward distribution by increasing points for favored pools or reducing/zeroing points for others, directly affecting yield farming profitability across different pools.                                                                                                                | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | updateBoostMultiplier         | This function sets the boost multiplier value for a specific NFT position within the range of 100% to 200% of base rewards. This multiplier directly modifies the effective liquidity calculation used for reward distribution, increasing rewards for boosted positions while proportionally decreasing rewards for others. Setting the maximum 200% boost for selected positions doubles their CAKE rewards while reducing the proportional rewards for all other positions in the same pool.       | FarmBooster                                           |
| MasterChefV3                 | upkeep                        | This function transfers CAKE tokens from the receiver address to the contract and sets the parameters for the next reward distribution period (duration and tokens per second). This operation determines the total rewards available for distribution and establishes the timeframe during which these rewards will be allocated. Failure to call this function at the end of a distribution period immediately stops all CAKE rewards across all farming pools.                                     | MasterChefV3Receiver                                  |
| MasterChefV3                 | updatePools                   | This function forces immediate calculation and recording of accumulated rewards for specified pools by calling accumulateReward on their respective LM pools. This ensures rewards are properly tracked up to the current block, particularly important before allocation point changes or at period boundaries. Missing updates to specific pools creates accounting discrepancies in reward distribution, leading to incorrect reward amounts for users who deposit or withdraw during this period. | unknown multisig 2 or operator (0x0 not assigned)     |
| MasterChefV3                 | setOperator                   | This function changes the operatorAddress variable that has permission to call the updatePools function. This address has administrative capabilities over reward calculation timing but not over allocation points or other critical parameters. An operator can manipulate reward calculations by selectively updating certain pools while ignoring others, creating temporary reward distribution imbalances.                                                                                      | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | setPeriodDuration             | This function modifies the PERIOD_DURATION variable which sets the default timeframe for reward distribution periods (between 1 and 30 days). This duration parameter affects how frequently rewards are calculated and how long each batch of CAKE rewards is distributed. Shorter periods increase the frequency of required upkeep calls while longer periods create extended commitments to existing allocation structures.                                                                       | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3                 | updateFarmBoostContract       | This function replaces the FarmBooster contract address which determines which NFT positions receive boosted rewards and by what multiplier. This contract has exclusive permission to call updateBoostMultiplier, directly controlling the reward multipliers for all staked positions. A malicious boost contract can implement arbitrary multiplier logic, redirecting rewards to specific positions by maximizing their multipliers while minimizing others.                                      | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | renounceOwnership             | This function permanently relinquishes control of the contract by setting the owner to the zero address. It removes any future possibility for upgrades or maintenance of the contract, making all functions protected by onlyOwner permanently inaccessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | transferOwnership             | This function transfers complete control of the contract and its upgrade mechanisms to a new address. It changes which entity can execute future upgrades of the contract and manage fee distribution. Transferring ownership to a malicious or compromised address would give that entity complete control over the protocol's fee collection and distribution system.                                                                                                                               | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | upgradeTo                     | This function replaces the implementation contract of the proxy with a new address. This change affects all aspects of the contract's behavior as the entire codebase is replaced. A malicious implementation could steal all funds held by the proxy or redirect future protocol fees to arbitrary addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                        | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | upgradeToAndCall              | This function replaces the contract implementation and executes a specified function with arbitrary parameters in a single atomic transaction. It allows immediate modification of contract state during the upgrade process, enabling direct manipulation of funds, permissions, and configuration. A malicious implementation could instantly transfer all collected fees to unauthorized addresses and permanently compromise the fee collection system without requiring separate transactions.   | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | collectFee                    | This function collects fees according to the configured rate and adds them to the total fee amount in the contract. It controls the accumulation of protocol fees that will later be distributed to stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | unknown multisig 1 or Operator                        |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | swap                          | This function executes exchanges of collected tokens via the 1inch aggregator (0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582). It converts collected fees into other tokens according to specified parameters and updates fee allocations accordingly. This function is essential for consolidating various fee tokens before their final distribution.                                                                                                                                                  | unknown multisig 1 or Operator                        |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | smart_router_swap             | This function executes exchanges of collected tokens via the PancakeSwap SmartRouter (0x13f4EA83D0bd40E75C8222255bc855a974568Dd4). It uses a low-level call to execute the provided exchange data and verifies that the minimum return amount is respected. This function allows fee conversions to remain within the PancakeSwap ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                          | unknown multisig 1 or Operator                        |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | sendCake                      | This function reduces the contract's internal CAKE token accounting balances and transfers the specified amounts to burn and vault addresses defined in PCSV2FeeHandler. It finalizes the fee distribution process by executing the actual token transfers according to the predefined allocation model. If not called regularly, accumulated CAKE tokens would remain in the contract instead of being distributed to their intended destinations.                                                   | unknown multisig 1 or Operator                        |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setStargateComposer           | This function updates the contract address that is authorized to call the sgReceive function for cross-chain fee transfers. It changes which external system can interact with the fee handler when receiving tokens from other blockchains. Setting an incorrect address would prevent all incoming cross-chain fee transfers from being processed correctly.                                                                                                                                        | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setPancakeV3Factory           | This function updates the address of the PancakeSwap V3 factory that the fee handler interacts with for collecting protocol fees and managing factory settings. It determines which factory contract receives administrative commands from the fee handler, including protocol fee configurations. Setting this to an address that doesn't implement the required interface would cause all factory-related operations to fail due to invalid function calls.                                         | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setOperator                   | This function changes the address that can execute functions protected by the onlyOwnerOrOperator modifier, including fee collection, swaps, and token distributions. It enables the owner to delegate operational responsibilities without transferring full contract ownership. The designated operator gains immediate access to execute all operationally sensitive functions that directly handle protocol fee tokens.                                                                           | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFeeRate                    | This function defines how collected protocol fees are distributed between burn, treasury, and user allocations for a specific fee tier. It directly determines the proportions of protocol revenue allocated to each destination, with a requirement that the sum of allocations equals 100% (RATE_DENOMINATOR). Setting an allocation to 0% for any category would completely eliminate that aspect of the protocol's fee distribution model.                                                        | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | withdraw                      | This function reduces the internal fee counters (feeAmount) for a specific token and transfers the total amount to the designated address. It directly moves collected tokens from their planned allocations (burn, treasury, user) to an external destination, bypassing the standard distribution process. A complete withdrawal of all allocations would immediately halt the planned distribution mechanism for those tokens.                                                                     | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | recoverToken                  | This function transfers tokens from the contract that are not accounted for in fee allocations, verifying that the current balance minus accounted fees is sufficient for the requested amount. It provides a recovery mechanism for tokens sent to the contract by mistake without disturbing existing fee allocations. A recovery performed immediately after a swap but before fees are accounted for could include legitimate revenue not yet recorded in the allocation system.                  | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | topUpOperator                 | This function transfers native BNB/ETH to the operator address, limited by PCSV2FeeHandler.operatorTopUpLimit(). It funds the operator's maintenance operations, particularly to cover gas fees required for management transactions. Repeated transfers up to the maximum limit could transfer all native BNB/ETH from the contract to the operator if the contract is not replenished.                                                                                                              | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | addDestination                | This function authorizes a token as a destination for collected fee conversions. Without this authorization, fees cannot be converted to this token, blocking the consolidation and distribution of protocol revenue for that specific token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | removeDestination             | This function removes a token's authorization as a fee conversion destination. If applied to an essential token like CAKE, this action would immediately block the process of converting and distributing collected fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryOwner               | This function transfers complete control of the V3 factory to a new address. A permanent transfer deprives the fee system of its authority over pool creation and protocol fee collection, directly affecting the protocol's fee mechanism for all users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | enableFactoryFeeAmount        | This function activates a new fee tier with the specified tick spacing in the PancakeSwap V3 factory. It permanently adds a new option for future pool creation without affecting existing pools. Once activated, this fee tier cannot be deactivated, becoming a permanent option for all future pools.                                                                                                                                                                                              | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryWhiteListAddress    | This function updates the whitelist status of an address in the PancakeSwap V3 Factory. It controls which addresses can create pools when the factory has whitelisting enabled. Improper whitelisting could allow unauthorized entities to create official pools or restrict legitimate pool creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryFeeAmountExtraInfo  | This function configures the parameters of a fee tier, including whether it requires whitelisting and if it is enabled. It only affects new pools to be created and has no impact on existing pools. Disabling a fee tier (enabled=false) immediately prevents the creation of new pools with this tier.                                                                                                                                                                                              | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryLmPoolDeployer      | This function changes the address of the liquidity mining pool deployer. It only affects future mining pools and not those already deployed. The risk for users is the immediate interruption of new reward program deployments, which may limit farming opportunities on new pools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryFeeProtocol         | This function modifies the percentage of trading fees that goes to the protocol for a specific pool. It directly affects existing pools, immediately changing the fee distribution. For users providing liquidity, an increase in protocol fees proportionally reduces their revenue without any opt-out option other than withdrawing liquidity.                                                                                                                                                     | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | setFactoryLmPool              | This function associates a V3 trading pool with a liquidity mining pool. It can affect both existing and new pools. For users, an incorrect change can immediately direct rewards to the wrong pool, depriving legitimate stakers of their expected rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PCSV3FeeHandler              | _authorizeUpgrade             | This internal function checks whether a contract upgrade is authorized. It implements the access control that restricts who can upgrade the contract implementation. This is a critical security function that prevents unauthorized changes to the contract's code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | unknown multisig 1                                    |
| PancakeV3LmPoolDeployer      | deploy                        | This function deploys a new LMPool contract for a specific V3 pool. It only affects new liquidity mining pools at the time of their creation and has no impact on existing pools. This function is critical as it establishes the link between V3 pools and the reward system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | MasterChefV3                                          |
| FarmBooster                  | updatePositionBoostMultiplier | This function verifies the consistency of position data for a specific NFT and always returns the standard multiplier (100%). It doesn't apply any variable boost but only performs a safety check between boost liquidity and existing multiplier. In this implementation, no position receives a boost beyond 100%, contrary to what its name suggests.                                                                                                                                             | MasterChefV3                                          |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | renounceOwnership             | This function allows the owner to permanently renounce ownership of the contract, making all administrative functions permanently inaccessible. Once renounced, no further updates to the reward distribution system will be possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | transferOwnership             | This function transfers complete control of the contract to a new address. The new owner gains all administrative rights, including CAKE fund management and reward system configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | depositForMasterChefV2Pool    | This function deposits CAKE tokens into the specified MasterChefV2 pool. It affects the source of CAKE tokens that will be distributed to V3 farming participants. This deposit is essential for maintaining the reward flow between V2 and V3 systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | upkeep                        | This function transfers CAKE tokens from MasterChefV2 to MasterChefV3 and configures parameters for the next reward distribution period. It determines the total amount of available rewards and establishes the timeframe during which these rewards will be distributed. If this function is not called at the end of a distribution period, all CAKE rewards immediately cease across all farming pools.                                                                                           | unknown multisig 2 or MasterChefV3KeeperV1 (operator) |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | setOperator                   | This function changes the operator address that is authorized to call the upkeep function. It modifies who can maintain the CAKE reward flow to the V3 farming system. A malicious operator can disrupt reward distribution by failing to maintain the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3Receiver         | withdraw                      | This function allows the owner to withdraw any token from the contract to a specified address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | setRegister                   | This function sets the address authorized to call performUpkeep. It controls which entity can trigger the automatic process of transferring CAKE rewards from MasterChefV2 to MasterChefV3. The address cannot be set to zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | setBufferSecond               | This function sets the buffer time before the end of the current period during which the system allows a new upkeep. Setting this value too high could cause distribution periods to overlap, while setting it too low risks creating interruptions in rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | setUpkeepBufferSecond         | This function sets the minimum time between two upkeep executions, preventing duplicate transactions. It directly affects the maximum frequency at which rewards can be distributed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | setPeriodDuration             | This function modifies the duration of the reward distribution period (between 1 and 30 days). Shorter periods require more frequent upkeeps, while longer periods extend the commitment to the existing allocation structure. Will revert if the period duration is outside the allowed range.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | performUpkeep                 | This function calls upkeep on the Receiver contract, triggering the transfer of CAKE to MasterChefV3 and establishing the next reward period. It only executes when the last period start time plus the upkeep buffer has passed. If this function is not executed regularly, all CAKE rewards cease.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | unknown address 3 (Register)                          |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | pause                         | This function suspends the automatic execution of upkeeps by calling the internal _pause function from the Pausable contract, immediately blocking the flow of new CAKE rewards to MasterChefV3. This directly affects users who will no longer receive new rewards until the function is deactivated.                                                                                                                                                                                                | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | unpause                       | This function reactivates the automatic execution of upkeeps by calling the internal _unpause function, allowing the resumption of CAKE rewards flow to MasterChefV3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | unknown multisig 2 (owner)                            |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | transferOwnership             | This function transfers complete control of the contract to a new address. The new owner gains all administrative rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | unknown multisig 2                                    |
| MasterChefV3KeeperV1         | renounceOwnership             | This function allows the owner to permanently renounce ownership of the contract, making all administrative functions permanently inaccessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | unknown multisig 2                                    |
