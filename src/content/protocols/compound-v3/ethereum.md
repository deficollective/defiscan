# Summary

Compound-v3 is a lending protocol that accepts a base asset as liquidity and allows borrowing this base asset with a variety of other assets as collateral. Multiple base assets are supported such as USDC, WETH, USDT, wstETH, and USDS. Each base asset represents an isolated lending market managed by a separate instance of the protocol. Compound governance is able to update various parameters for each of these markets.

# Ratings

## Chain

Compound-v3 is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The Compound-v3 protocol is fully upgradeable allowing for the update of governance and markets logic and state (specifically the `Governance` and `Comet` implementation contracts). This can result in the loss of funds or unclaimed yield as well as lead to other changes in the expected performance of the protocol.

The permission to upgrade the protocol is controlled by an onchain governance system with `COMP` token holders submitting and voting on respective proposals. A multisig account, the `ProposalGuardian`, has the permission to cancel proposals to mitigate the risk of malicious or otherwise unintended proposals. This role can potentially be abused to censor proposals.

Furthermore, another multisig account, the `PauseGuardian`, has the permission to pause markets, disabling depositing and withdrawing assets, if suspicious activity is detected. This role can potentially be abused to freeze funds and unclaimed yield in the protocol.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

The compound-v3 protocol relies on a Chainlink oracle feed to price collateral and base assets in the system. The protocol does not validate asset prices returned by Chainlink or offer a fallback oracle mechanism. The replacement of a stale or untrusted oracle feed requires a Compound governance vote with a delay (see [Exit Window](#exit-window)).

The Chainlink oracle system itself is upgradeable without decentralized ownership over those permissions. Chainlink Price feeds thus achieves a _High_ centralization risk score as discussed in a separate report [here](/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum).

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Permissions, including protocol upgrades, are controlled by an onchain governance system. `COMP` holders are able to create new proposals (requires 25,000 `COMP`) and vote on proposals (at least 400,000 votes are required for a valid proposal). A minimum voting period of 3 days is enforced as well as a delay of 2 days for the implementation of successful proposals.

While this does not meet the 7-day exit window requirement, malicious or unintended proposals can be intercepted by the `ProposalGuardian` multisig account.

However, both the `ProposalGuardian` and the `PauseGuardian` multisig accounts do not meet the Security Council requirements ([see below](#security-council)).

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The frontend of Compound V3 is open source. Instructions to deploy it locally or deploy it
on IPFS are available [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/palisade). However, the frontend depends on a separate backend that is accessed through [v3-api.compound.finance/](https://v3-api.compound.finance/). Therefore, self-hosting does not help if the backend is down.
Nonetheless, compound is supported on third-party apps like DeFiSaver. These apps build an acceptable backup solution in case of failure of the official frontend and backend.

> Accessibility score: Low

## Conclusion

The Compound-v3 Ethereum mainnet protocol achieves High centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Autonomy_ and _Exit Window_ dimensions. It thus ranks Stage 0.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by 1) adopting a _Security Council_ setup for the `ProposalGuardian` and `PauseGuardian` multisig accounts, and 2) implementing validity checks and a fallback mechanism around the Chainlink oracle (or Chainlink adopting a _Security Council_ setup for its own multisig account).

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Reviewer notes

⚠️ During our analysis, we noticed many of the contract addresses listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.compound.finance/) are out of date. This is most likely explained by the high frequency of updates to the implementation contracts. The list below was last updated on the 20th of February 2025.

# Protocol Analysis

Below is an overview of the contracts from the Compound V3 protocol.

![Overview of the compound protocol](../diagrams/compound-v3-overview.png)

## Upgrade process

Any market parameter change requires a new `Comet` deployment. The process is as follows:

1.  new parameters are set using setters in the `Configurator` contract.
2.  the `ProxyAdmin` contract uses `deployAndUpgradeTo`:
    1. Deploys a new comet contract through the `Configurator`, which uses the `CometFactory`.
    2. Updates the corresponding `Comet Proxy` to point to this newly deployed contract.

A malicious update could simply perform the update to the `Comet Proxy`to introduce a malicious `Comet Implementation` contract, effectively stealing funds.
This is because the `upgrade` function can still be called by the DAO in addition to `deployAndUpgradeTo`, allowing the DAO to deploy `Comet` contracts not created by the `Configurator`.

The process is illustrated below.

# Dependencies

The compound-v3 protocol relies on a Chainlink oracle feed to price collateral and base assets in the system. The protocol does not validate asset prices returned by Chainlink feeds other than checking for a zero-value. The protocol further does not offer a fallback pricing mechanism in case the Chainlink oracle feeds are stale or untrusted. If not performing as expected, Chainlink oracle feeds can only be replaced through a regular Compound governance proposal with a delay (see Exit Window).

Chainlink achieves a _High_ centralization risk score as discussed in a separate report [here](/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum).

# Governance

The Compound protocol is governed and upgraded by `COMP` token-holders, using three distinct components; the `COMP` token, governance module (`GovernorBravo`), and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative functions of a cToken or the `Comptroller`. Proposals can modify system parameters, support new markets, or add entirely new functionality to the protocol.

`COMP` token-holders can delegate their voting rights to themselves, or an address of their choice.

Governor Bravo is the governance module of the protocol; it allows addresses with more than 25,000 `COMP` to propose changes to the protocol; any address can lock 100 `COMP` to create an _Autonomous Proposal_, which becomes a governance proposal after being delegated 25,000 `COMP` .The minimum number of votes required for an account to create a proposal is set via `proposalThreshold`. This can be changed through governance.

When a governance proposal is created, it enters a 2-day review period, after which voting weights are recorded and voting begins. Voting lasts for 3 days, addresses that held voting weight, at the start of the proposal, invoked through the `getpriorvotes` function, can submit their votes. if a majority, and at least 400,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented 2 days later. In total, any change to the protocol takes at least one week.

## Security Council

A security council called `Pause Guardian` has the power to pause all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
in the protocol. The guardian is currently a 4/8 multisig made of Compound DAO community members. The signers announced [on the governance forum](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134/18). The same multisig is also `Proposal Guardian` and has the power to cancel Governance Proposals before their executions.

A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin                   | upgradeAndCall                        | Triggers the update of either a `Comet (Implementation)` contract or `Configurator (Implementation)` contract and calls a function in the new contract. A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin                   | renounceOwnership                     | Abandons ownership of the contract. The DAO would renounce the access to the administrative functions of the contracts, which includes upgrading the `Comet Implementation` and `Configurator Implementation` contracts. Without other prior adaptations this could present a vulnerability as it would freeze the parameters of the `Comet (Implementation)`contracts.                                                                                   | Timelock (DAO)                 |

| ProxyAdmin                        | transferOwnership                     | Updates the owner of the `ProxyAdmin` contract: the account with the rights to upgrade the `CompoundGovernor` contrat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CometRewards                      | setRewardConfig                       | Set the reward token for a `Comet` instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CometRewards                      | withdrawToken                         | Withdraw reward tokens from the contract. This could drain all the tokens held on the contract to any output address if the DAO approves the proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CometRewards                      | transferGovernor                      | Transfers the governor rights to a new address. A malicious governor could withdraw all reward tokens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Proxy)          | upgradeToAndCall                      | Updates the implementation of the `Compound Governor` contract. Can only be triggered by the DAO itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | setQuorum                             | Updates the governance's quorum: the minimum amount of votes for a proposal to be valid and can only be set by the DAO itself. A lower value could make the protocol more vulnerable to malicious proposals while a higher value could prevent future updates.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | setLateQuorumVoteExtension            | Updates the value of the vote extension parameter. The vote extension parameter is the number of blocks that are required to pass from the time a proposal reaches quorum until its voting period ends. This could be an additional security to ensure voters have time to express their opinion if a proposal reaches quorum right before the end of the voting period.                                                                                  | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | setVotingDelay                        | Updates the voting delay parameter. The voting delay is the delay before voting on a proposal may take place, once proposed, in blocks. This delay is part of the overall time between a proposal is made and executed and contributes to the exit window.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | setVotingPeriod                       | Updates the voting period parameter. The voting period is the time people have to vote on a proposal. A lower period increases the vulnerability of the protocol as people have less time to deny a malicious proposal in the case of an attacker with a voting power high enough to cover the quorum.                                                                                                                                                    | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | setProposalThreshold                  | Updates the proposal threshold parameter. The proposal threshold is the number of votes required for a voter to become a proposer. If this number is too low it could allow users to flood the governance with proposals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | TimeLock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | updateTimelock                        | Updates the governance's underlying TimeLock instance. Can only be done through the current TimeLock (by the governance). A malicious proposal could remove the TimeLock's delay, which would mean removing the exit window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| CompoundGovernor (Implementation) | cancel                                | Cancels an active proposal. Anyone can cancel a proposal if the proposer's voting power fell below the proposal threshold. The proposal guardian and the proposer itself are allowed to cancel a proposal at any time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Proposal Guardian & Proposer   |
| TimeLock                          | setDelay                              | Updates the delay to wait between when a proposal is accepted and when it is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| TimeLock                          | setPendingAdmin                       | Updates the TimeLock's admin. This can be used if the Governor contract is updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Timelock (DAO)                 |
| TimeLock                          | queueTransaction                      | Queues a transaction that can be executed once a delay. Current dela is 2 days. This can impact the own TimeLock 's settings (change admin, set delays) or interaction with any other contract the DAO has permissions on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Governor (DAO)                 |
| TimeLock                          | cancelTransaction                     | Cancels a pending transaction and removes it from the queue. This allows the DAO to cancel one of its own decision before it is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Governor (DAO)                 |
| TimeLock                          | executeTransaction                    | Executes a transaction that was previously queued, if the corresponding delay has passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Governor (DAO)                 |

The permissions for all Comet contracts (USDC, WETH, wsETH, USDT, USDS) are similar and therefore only
represented once as `Comet Proxy` and `Comet Implementation`in the table above.
