# Summary

Spark is a protocol within the Sky ecosystem and consists of two main products: _Savings USDS_ and _SparkLend_.

_Savings USDS_ is a savings product offering a fixed return on various stablecoins including `USDS`, `DAI` and `USDC`.

_SparkLend_ is a lending protocol that enables users to lend and borrow various crypto assets. It offers deep stablecoin liquidity that is provided to a large part by Sky through Spark's _Liquidity Management Layer_.

Spark's _Liquidity Management Layer_ allocates Sky stablecoin liquidity to various DeFi lending markets including _SparkLend_. The focus in this review is thus on its role within _SparkLend_ itself.

# Ratings

## Chain

Spark's products are deployed on multiple chains. This review focuses on the Ethereum mainnet deployments.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The upgradeability of Spark is limited. The _SparkLend_ markets are not upgradeable, but the treasury (collected fees) and rewards contracts may be upgraded through the _Sky Governance_. Upgrading the rewards contracts may cancel the existing rewards and result in the _loss of unclaimed yield_. This is because the rewards are part of the yield advertised to users. The _Sky Governance_ and the [SparkLend Freezer](#security-council) multisig can both freeze all funds deposited into _SparkLend_ with no delay. If those funds are not unfrozen by a _Sky Governance_ proposal, this would lea to the _loss of user funds_.

_Savings USDS_ on Ethereum mainnet only interacts with the original `sUSDS` contract deployed by the _Sky Governance_. This contract is upgradeable, but this upgradeability is counted in Spark's dependency on Sky in the [autonomy section](#autonomy).

> Upgradeability Score: High

## Autonomy

Spark has a critical dependency on the Sky Protocol, a [Stage 0 protocol](./sky.md). This dependency is two-fold. On the governance level, all key permissions in Spark contracts are held by the _Sky Governance_, this means that at this time, Spark is effectively managed by Sky. On the protocol level, Spark depends on Sky's products: `USDS` and `sUSDS` are both managed by Sky which, among other critical permissions, holds the rights to upgrade those contracts to any new logic.

Spark's own _Liquidity Management Layer (ALM)_ can be seen as a dependency for _SparkLend_ as it is responsible for providing a significant portion of the liquidity into _SparkLend_'s stablecoin markets. This layer is managed by [Relayers](#security-council) who allocate liquidity accross different DeFi protocols and chains within strict governance-defined limits. This can impact users indirectly by manipulation of interest rates. We explain this layer in more details in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis) and [dependencies](#dependencies) sections.

Finally, Chronicle price feeds are used in _SparkLend_ all asset prices. A failure of those oracles could lead to wrongful liquidations. We found Chronicle to be a _Medium Centralization_ dependency in a [dedicated report](/protocols/chronicle). An oracle killswitch was introduced to mitigate possible oracle failures. If a price falls below a certain threshold, the killswitch freezes all borrowing within _SparkLend_ until manually reset by the _Sky Governance_. Nonetheless, as discussed in [dependencies](#dependencies), this mitigation is only used for one price feed within _SparkLend_ and is not sufficient to mitigate all failures.

More information on the centralization and functioning of those dependencies can be found in [dependencies](#dependencies).

> Autonomy Score: High

## Exit Window

Spark is governed by _Sky Governance_ and the same _Exit Window_ of **18 hours** applies to regular updates, including upgrading the `RewardsControllerManager`, unfreezing markets, changing contract permisisons, or resetting the oracle killswitch.

Emergency Actions, including freezing all markets within _SparkLend_, can be executed by the _Sky Governance_ with no delay.
Furthermore, a [SparkLend Freezer](#security-council) multisig holds the same emergency permissions with only 2 signatures required out of 5 possible signers.

> Exit Window Score: High

## Accessibility

Spark has a main open-source frontend at [spark.fi](https://app.spark.fi). The code is open-source, and there are instructions to run the page locally as a developer. There are no dedicated instructions for self-hosting. Direct interaction with the contract is neither straightforward nor documented.

However, _SparkLend_ is accessible on third-party applications such as DeFiSaver and SummerFiPro. These apps build an acceptable backup solution in case of failure of the official frontend and backend.

> Accesibility score: Low

## Conclusion

Spark has a critical, unmitigated dependency on Sky, a _Stage 0_ protocol, for both its _Savings USDS_ and _SparkLend_ products. This results in a _High_ centralization score for Spark's _Autonomy_, _Upgradeability_, and _Exit Window_. Spark thus also achieves **Stage 0**.

Spark can advance to _Stage 1_, if Sky achieves _Stage 1_ and the [Sparklend Freezer](#security-council) is updated to a Security Council setup. Spark could further advance to _Stage 2_ if Sky achieves _Stage 2_, its Chronicle dependency achieves a _Low_ centralization score, and the [Sparklend Freezer](#security-council) permissions are assigned to an onchain governance system.

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Reviewer Notes

As mentioned in the summary, we only considered Spark's _Liquidity Management Layer_ as a dependency in this analysis, as it is not a user-facing product. Nonetheless, the _Liquidity Management Layer_ has been fully analysed in the [contracts and permissions](#contracts-and-permissions) section and is explained thoroughly in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis).

We believe it is worth noting that funds in the _Liquidity Management Layer_ may be sent out to other chains through _Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)_. The CCTP which relies on a set of centralized offchain signers to provide the bridging attestation. As this review is only concerned with _Ethereum Mainnet_, it does not count as a dependency. Nonetheless, it will influence the score of Spark on other chains receiving funds from the CCTP.

# Protocol Analysis

## SparkLend

_SparkLend_ is a `USDS` and `DAI`-centric lending protocol in which users can participate as lenders or borrowers.

The protocol is a fork of [Aave v3](/protocols/aave) with some particularities highlighted in the diagram below. Most contracts, including markets, are non-upgradeable, with upgrades only possible on the `Treasury` and `RewardsControllerManager` contracts. Upgrading the rewards may revoke unclaimed rewards and lead to the _loss of unclaimed yield_, as rewards are advertised as part of the yield. All critical permissions are held by the _Sky Governance_ through the `DSPause Proxy`.

Some emergency actions can be taken, such as freezing all new borrowing in _SparkLend_ if a certain asset price falls below a predetermined threshold. A multisig called [SparkLend Freezer](#security-council), as well as the _Sky Governance_, can freeze or pause any market in _SparkLend_ without any delay. They can then be reactivated through the delayed _Sky Governance_.

Spark has two rewards modules named `SparkRewards` and `SparkLendRewards`. `SparkRewards` is a global rewards program that may reward users for any specific action that promotes the use of Spark. This may include using a specific _SparkLend_ market. On the other hand, `SparkLendRewards` is a rewards module inherited from Aave v3, which allows the distribution of rewards for specific _SparkLend_ Markets. Both reward modules have their respective mulsitigs with 2-out-of-3 signers, and both have been used in the past to distribute rewards promoting the use of _SparkLend_.

## Savings USDS

As shown in the picture, Spark's _Savings USDS_ on Ethereum mainnet is simply Sky's native savings rate. This module is managed by the _Sky Governance_ and is considered a dependency.

![Overview of Savings USDS](./diagrams/spark-savings.png)

## Spark Liquidity Management

Spark has a _Liquidity Management Layer (ALM)_ whose role is to automate liquidity provision of `USDS`, `sUSDS`, and `USDC` directly from Sky and across blockchain networks and DeFi protocols. The overview of this system is shown in the diagram below. No contracts in the ALM are upgradeable, and all critical permissions are held by the _Sky Governance_ through its delayed proxy (`DSPause Proxy`). The `Spark Proxy` is a simple wrapper around the _Sky Governance_ to distinguish permissions specific to Spark. The `AllocatorVault` bridges between Sky and Spark and allows minting/burning of `USDS`.

The main component of the ALM is the `ALMProxy` and its `MainnetController`. The `ALMProxy` holds all the funds while the `MainnetController` can move and distribute those funds across protocols and chains. An offchain [Relayers](#security-council) multistig made of 2 signers with a threshold of 1 can dictate all liquidity movements. However, the relayers are subject to strict rate limits and can only allocate funds to pre-approved contracts. A [Freezer](#security-council) multisig can freeze the relayers at any time if it detects suspicious behaviors. The `MainnetController` supports the provision of liquidity in Aave, Ethena, and any ERC-4626 compatible (pre-approved) vault.

# Dependencies

## Sky

Spark has a critical dependency on the Sky Protocol, a _Stage 0_ protocol. This dependency is at two levels. First, Spark revolves around `USDS`, the Sky USD stablecoin and its associated savings rate (`sUSDS`). If `USDS` came to fail due to various reasons or be upgraded maliciously, this would severely impact Spark. The savings module can also be updated by Sky. The detailed analysis of Sky's centralization can be found [here](/protocols/sky).

In addition to that, all critical permissions in Spark are currently held by the _Sky Governance_. This means that at this time, Spark is effectively managed by Sky.

## Spark's Liquidity Management Layer

Spark's _Liquidity Management Layer (ALM)_ is a dependency for _SparkLend_ as it provides part of the liquidity in the markets. As explained in the [Protocol Analysis](#protocol-analysis), the layer is managed by two relayers who attribute liquidity in different DeFi protocols to promote `USDS`. An mismanagement of the liquidity layer by the relayers could result in the withdrawal of all the available liquidity, spiking interest rates for _SparkLend_ borrowers. Liquidity management can be done without delay, but within strict limits set by the _Sky Governance_. The management by [Relayers](#security-council) may be paused by the [Freezer](#security-council) if it detects a malfunction or malicious actions. The [Freezer](#security-council) does not meet our Security Council requirements.

## Chronicle

Currently, Chronicle oracles are used in _SparkLend_ with no fallbacks for all asset prices. We assessed that Chronicle is a _Medium Centralization_ (_Stage 1_ equivalent) dependency and explained it in detail in a [dedicated report](/protocols/chronicle).

A `KillSwitchOracle` contract is used to set critical prices per asset in case of potential oracle failure or manipulation. If the oracle returns a price below the critical price for an asset, anyone can disable the oracle and pause all borrowing of all assets within _SparkLend_ until the killswitch is reset by the _Sky Governance_.

This feature could potentially serve as an effective mitigation for centralization vectors in _SparkLend_'s oracle dependency. However, the current `KillSwitchOracle` contract only implements protections against untrusted lower prices and does not account for potential untrusted higher prices. Furthermore, at the time of writing this revew, only one killswitch is in place within _SparkLend_, for the stETH/ETH price feed, limiting potential depegs at 0.95 stETH/ETH.

As a result, in its current form, the `KillSwitchOracle` contract does not offer a comprehensive mitigation for centralization risks in _SparkLend_'s oracle dependency.

# Governance

All critical permissions in Spark are held by the _Sky Governance_. More details on the exact functioning of
the _Sky Governance_ can be found in the [Sky Review] (https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/sky).

## Exit Window

Spark does not add any further delay to _Sky Governance_ decisions. _Sky Governance_ proposals are delayed by **18 hours**, set by the _Sky Governance_ itself (see [Sky review](./sky.md#exit-window)).

Emergency proposals are prepared for the _Sky Governance_ to freeze all markets within _SparkLend_ without any delay, which would prevent users from withdrawing their funds. Those actions could be executed without delay, but still require a vote and a majority according to Sky's continuous approval system. In addition to that, a [SparkLend Freezer](#security-council) multi-sig holds the same emergency permissions with only 2 signatures required out of 5 possible signers.

If an oracle's killswitch is triggered (see [dependencies](#dependencies)), the borrowing is disabled without delay for all assets across the protocol until the killswitch is reset by the _Sky Governance_.

## Security Council

The table below shows the permissions owners, in the Spark protocol in addition to the governance.

The [Freezer](#security-council) multisig can freeze the movement of liquidity in the ALM while the [SparkLend Freezer](#security-council) can freeze one or all markets in _SparkLend_. They do not meet our Security Council requirements and the signers are not publicly announced.
