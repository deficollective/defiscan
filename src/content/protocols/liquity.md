# Summary

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Learn more about these mechanisms under Liquidation.

# Overview

## Chain

The Liquity protocol is deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

> Chain score: L

## Upgradeability

All permissions in the system have been renounced and the protocol is fully immutable. No upgrades or changes can be made to the protocol, its functions or parameters.

> Upgradeability score: L

## Autonomy

Liquity relies on two external oracles, Chainlink (primary) and Tellor (fallback), but has a robust fallback mechanism in place, using the "last good price" if both oracles fail or become untrusted. This ensures the protocol can continue operating without interruption, minimizing the impact of oracle failure on its performance. Despite its reliance on external oracles, Liquityâ€™s fallback systems mitigates the risk of disruptions.

> Autonomy score: L

## Exit Window

Liquityâ€™s contracts are fully immutable, no upgrades or changes can be made, removing the need for an exit window.

> Exit Window score: L

## Accessibility

Multiple user interfaces exist and are operated by independent actors ensuring access to the protocol and user funds even if an interface is shutdown or censors a user's transactions.

## Dependencies

The only external protocol dependency is an ETH/USD price feed (the Oracle) which is used to compute the value of usersâ€™ collateral when minting LUSD, redeeming LUSD or liquidating troves.

The system relies on two different oracles: Chainlink is the primary oracle and Tellor is the fallback oracle in case the chainlink price feed is frozen or untrusted. The Chainlink price feed is deployed at `0x3D7aE7E594f2f2091Ad8798313450130d0Aba3a0`, the Tellor oracle is deployed at `0xAd430500ECDa11E38C9bCB08a702274b94641112`.

If both Chainlink and Tellor are frozen or untrusted the last good price is used and the system keeps operating allowing users to withdraw their assets.

## Exit Window

The protocol is completely immutable, thus no exit window is required ðŸŽ‰

# Security Council
