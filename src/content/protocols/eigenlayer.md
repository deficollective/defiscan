## Chain

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#chain for more guidance.

> Chain score: Low/Medium/High

## Upgradeability

In the upgradability section & risk we address bytecode upgrades and parameter changes that are permissioned.

We wrote a section explaining the Upgradeability Risk in our framework here: See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#upgradability

For some practical guidance follow this steps. It will help you in writing a nice report:

1. Run the [permission scanner](https://github.com/deficollective/permission-scanner)
2. Fill in all the permissioned functions in the table (`## Permissions`)
   - Remember: Each function with a permission needs to be considered when determining the risk on Upgradability
3. Get a mechanistic and precise understanding of each permissioned function
4. Assess impact for each function, look out for
   - loss/blocking of user funds
   - loss of unclaimed yield
   - change expected behavior significantly (blacklisting/kyc/fees/...)
5. Write the impact column based on your understanding
   - A good tipp when writing the impact column below, think of least 2,3 sentences:
   1. First sentence: what it does technically, e.g "It assigns a new address to the owner variable"
   2. Second: what is the impact within the system, e.g "The owner is permissioned to raise fees"
   3. Third: Imagine faulty or malicious action, e.g "The malicious owner could raise fees to 100%, redirecting all future yield.
6. Summarise and abstract away technical details in this section here (`## Upgradeability`)

> Upgradeability score: Low/Medium/High

## Autonomy

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#autonomy for more guidance.

> Autonomy score: Low/Medium/High

## Exit Window

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#exit-window for more guidance.

> Exit Window score: Low/Medium/High

## Accessibility

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#accessibility for more guidance.

> Accessibility score: Low/Medium/High

## Conclusion

Some text in form of:

The xyz protocol achieves High centralization risk scores for its Upgradeability, Autonomy and Exit Window dimensions. It thus ranks Stage 0.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by ...

The project additionally could advance to Stage 2 if ...

# Reviewer's Notes

(Here, anything worth mentioning about what critical permissions you excluded from the scope or some elements that xyz protocol does in a unique way. If nothing seems relevant, just say that :)

| DelegationManager (Proxy)                | changeAdmin                                        | The admin can upgrade the `DelegationManager` contract. The `DelegationManager` contract manages delegations from restakers to operators. Restakers that want to withdraw from active (delegated) positions, need to call this contract to withdraw their funds. If this contract is maliciously upgraded it could block withdrawal of user funds or change claimable funds and yield.                                                                                              | ProxyAdmin                                                          |

| DelegationManager (Implementation)       | modifyOperatorDetails                              | Allows an operator to change the `delegation approver`. If the delegation approver is set to the 0-address, any staker can delegate their stake to the operator. If an delegation approver is configured all new stakers need to get a signature from the approver first, before they can delegate to this operator. Funds of existing stakers are not blocked when the operator transitions to a delegation approver setting, but the approver can return the stake to the staker. | only registered Operators                                           |
| DelegationManager (Implementation)       | updateOperatorMetadataURI                          | Allows an operator to update their metadata. The metadata is not stored in storage, but emitted as event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | only registered Operators                                           |

| DelegationManager (Implementation)       | slashOperatorShares                                | If the AVS slashes an Operator via `AllocationManager` contract, `the DelegationManager` contract is called to update the accounting for the operator's active shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AllocationManager                                                   |

The `StrategyFactory` contract allows to deploy new strategies, to accept new tokens as economic security to secure AVS by (re)stakers. Additionally, the contract allows to white- and blacklist the strategy. If the strategy is not whitelisted, no further deposits can be made, but user funds are not stuck to withdraw.                                                                                                | ProxyAdmin                                                          |

The contract does not control any funds, but the contract can block future deposits into single strategies. An false or malicious upgrade could only lead to a temporary/permanent block of new funds in form of ERC20 tokens, while Beacon deposits can still be used.                                                                                                                                          | ProxyAdmin                                                          |

This function additionally allows to atomically call a function after the upgrade took place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ProxyAdmin                                                          |

| StrategyFactory (Implementation)         | removeStrategiesFromWhitelist                      | The owner of this implementation contract can remove strategies from the whitelist. If removed from the whitelist, the stakers can still withdraw their funds, or delegate the funds to operators, but the Eigenlayer ecosystem does not allow new deposits. To prevent delegation of the token/strategy, AVS need to delist strategies from their operatorsets.                                                                                                                    | Operations Multisig                                                 |

Blacklisting also allows to block creation of strategies for this token before the strategy is created, and if the strategy is already created the consequence is removal from the whitelist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Operations Multisig                                                 |
