# Summary

This review focuses on EtherFi's `eETH`/`WeETH` protocol. `eETH` is a liquid restaking token designed to increase yield on top of native staking. `eETH` is backed by staked and restaked `ETH` through EigenLayer. The protocol implements native restaking at the protocol level, allowing holders to earn both staking and restaking rewards simultaneously without requiring separate actions or asset lockups. As such, the tokens can be used in other DeFi applications. In addition to this, the protocol introduced _Ether.fans_ NFTs which stake `ETH` exclusively with _Node Operators_ that use _Distributed Validators Technology (DVT)_.

# Ratings

## Chain

The protocol is deployed on several chains. This review focuses on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

All contracts in the protocol can be upgraded by a [4-out-of-7 multisig](#security-council) with a delay of 3 days. This includes the `eETH` and `WeETH` tokens and the contracts handling validator withdrawals. Through an upgrade, the multisig could reattribute the ownership of all funds in the protocol, which would lead to the _loss of user funds_ and _loss of unclaimed yield_. As the signers are not announced, it does not qualify for the role of security council.

An [oracle](#stakers-and-operators) with 2-out-of-3 signers reports onchain on the state of the beacon chain and the performance of the EtherFi validators. This information is critical to the functioning of the protocol and if manipulated could be used to mint excessive `eETH` and dilute users, or wrongfully rebase the token, leading to _loss of user funds_ and/or the _loss of unclaimed yield_. Once the oracle members submit a report, a [3-out-of-5 multisig](#security-council) has a limited 10 minutes window to cancel it, after which a [Depositor EOA](#security-council) can execute the corresponding actions through the `EtherFiAdmin`contract.

New validators are created in two phases when enough `ETH` has been depositted. First, any 1-of-6 signers of the [ValidatorSpawner multisig](#security-council) can create validators and deposit 1 `ETH` to them using user deposited `ETH` in the `LiquidityPool`. The oracle then confirms the validity of the withdrawal credential and triggers the deposit of the remaining `ETH` (> 31 `ETH` per validator). The initial deposit is at risk of frontrunning and collusion between the signer and _Node Operator_, this is why deposits have to be confirmed by the oracle. In case of an attack, this would allow the signer and _Node Operator_ to steal the 1 `ETH` depositted for each validator. However, this is of limitted impact given that this concerns a minority of protocol funds.

Restaking rewards are distributed either through the [KING Protocol](https://kingprotocol.org/) or EtherFi's own distributor contracts. Both solutions requires a multisig to post a merkle root onchain. The KING Protocol's root can be updated at any time by their [multisig](#security-council), which could be used to revoke distributed rewards and lead to the _loss of unclaimed yield_.

Contracts may also be paused without delay to prevent further deposits and withdrawals. Different multisigs may resume the contracts. In addition to that, user funds can be trapped in _Ether.fans_ NFTs with the possibility of adding withdrawal fees of up to 65 `ETH` per withdrawal.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

### Ethereum staking

EtherFi relies on _Node Operators_ to operate Ethereum validators. _Node Operators_ are whitelisted by EtherFi and users' funds are not in control by the _Node Operators_, as explained in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis). Nonetheless, the _Node Operators_ may misbehave and lose funds due to slashing, but they do not control the withdrawal address where the withdrawn funds are sent to. The withdrawal contract implements EIP7002 which allows it to trigger withdrawals onchain. The protocol can therefore handle both validator deposits and withdrawals without relying on _Node Operators_.

With the implementation of [EIP-7002](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) and the current diversification of node operators discussed in the [dependencies](#dependencies) section, EtherFi would score a _Low_ Autonomy risk score for its dependency on _Node Operators_.

### Restaking on Eigenlayer

The staked `ETH` associated with `eETH` is restaked onchain using the Eigenlayer protocol. EtherFi delegates their staked `ETH` to _Eigenlayer Operators_, those operators can choose which _Eigenlayer AVS_ they will operate for. EtherFi currently uses an implementation that could not lead to the _loss of user funds_ or _loss of unclaimed yield_ because there is no slashing of funds, as discussed in the [dependencies](#dependencies) section.

We analysed the Eigenlayer protocol to be of Stage 0 in a [dedicated report](/protocols/eigenlayer/ethereum#dependencies). However, the Eigenlayer protocol would be classified as Stage 1 if the criteria _Accessibility_ was ignored. Since EtherFi interacts programmatically with Eigenlayer, _Accessibility_ does not affect its centralization risks as a dependency. The Stage 1 equivalent dependency impacts EtherFi's own score and limits it to a _Medium_ centralization risk for the _Autonomy_ dimension.

Finally, other liquid staking tokens (LSTs), such as Lido's `stETH`, can be restaked on Eigenlayer and transformed into `eETH` using the `Liquifier` contract. In this case, the tokens are also restaked on Eigenlayer using a dedicated and predetermined strategy for each type of LST. The deposits are currently limited to `stETH` with a cap of 850'000 ETH. Since this represents less than 35% of EtherFi's TVL, this grants EtherFi a _Medium_ dependency on Lido.

> Autonomy score: Medium

## Exit Window

All contract upgrades are currently subject to a delay of 3 days. Day-to-day operations related to the EtherFi oracle, which include minting and burning `eETH` according to the data pushed onchain, are executed with a 10 minute delay once the consensus has been reached.

The protocol can be paused by an [undeclared `EOA`](#security-council), preventing both deposits and withdrawals without delay. The protocol can be resumed by a multisig or the `EtherFiAdmin` contract. Pausing the protocol can be modular, with non-facing user functions remaining accessible.

_Ether.fan_ fees can be changed without delay and with up to 65 `ETH` of fees per operation.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The official EtherFi frontends are [app.ether.fi](https://app.ether.fi/) for `eETH` and [ether.fan](https://ether.fan/) for _Ether.fans_. Neither frontends are open-source and no alternative frontends or self-hosting versions are available.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The protocol achieves _High_ centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Exit Window_, and _Accessibility_ section, as well as _Medium_ for the _Autonomy_ dimension. It thus scores **Stage 0**.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by integrating a 7-day _Exit Window_ on all upgrades and actions that may lead to _loss of user funds_. Additionally, it would need to offer either an open-sourced alternative frontend or a possibility for user to self-host the existing app.

# Reviewer's Notes

[Starting October 15th](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/king-protocol-formerly-lrt), restaking rewards will be distributed in the form of `KING` tokens using the King protocol. The older distribution contracts are no longer listed in EtherFi's documentation.

There is an important distinction to be made between Ethereum _Node Operators_ and _Eigenlayer Operators_. The former are operators which run Ethereum validators using staked `ETH`, while the latter act as operators in the _Eigenlayer_ protocol using restaked `ETH`. While some entities perform both tasks, they are different roles in different protocols.

This review reflects the state of EtherFi to the date of publication. We note that EtherFi is a fast evolving protocol and [implementation addresses](#contracts) should be verified to detect any upgrades since the last changes.

As part of their ongoing updates, the access control of most EtherFi contracts is being updated to use the `RoleRegistry (2)` contract for better traceability and auditability. However, some contracts, including the `MemershipManager` and `MembershipNFTs` used for _Ether.fans_ are not yet following this standard and it is not currently possible to audit the holders of the _admin_ role. As it is the case for other operative functions, we assume that those roles are partly granted to undeclared Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).

# Protocol Analysis

## Liquid ReStaking

An overview of the EtherFi protocol can be seen in the diagram below.

![Overview of EtherFi](../diagrams/etherfi-liquid-restaking.png)

### Node Operators

First, _Node Operators_ register themselves through the `NodeOperatorManager` contract, providing their IPFS hash containing encrypted validator keys and declaring the total number of keys they can operate. Once registered, these operators must be whitelisted via the _addToWhitelist_ function by the [Depositor EOA](#security-council) or [Multisig #1](#security-council) and approved for specific funding sources through _batchUpdateOperatorsApprovedTags_ to differentiate between standard `eETH` staking and ether.fan membership NFT staking. Ether.fan staking is meant for _Node Operators_ using _Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)_ exclusively.

### Validator Creation

_Node Operators_ then participate in the auction system by calling the _createBid_ function in the `AuctionManager` contract, where they submit a bid amount per validator. When sufficient `ETH` has accumulated in the `LiquidityPool`, any signer of the [ValidatorSpawner](#security-council) can initiate validator creation by selecting specific bid IDs from the auction and calling the _batchRegister_ function, which transfers one `ETH` per validator from the pool to the `StakingManager` contract where which processes each validator and links the validator's public key to its designated `EtherFiNode` withdrawal safe contract. Each validator has its own `EtherFiNode` contract that will receive rewards and handle withdrawal operations. Finally, one `ETH` is deposited to the official Ethereum beacon chain deposit contract.

Once the initial deposit is confirmed with the correct withdrawal address, the oracle triggers the remaining deposit to complete the validator creation process using `ETH` in the `LiquidityPool`.

### ReStaking

When `EtherFiNode` contracts are created, they deploy automatically a corresponding `EigenPod` using the `EigenPodManager`. `EigenPod` are contracts that enable restaking on Eigenlayer. The validator used for restaking have to have the `Eigenpod` as withdrawal address, this enables the Eigenlayer protocol to handle the withdrawn `ETH` and potentially slash the staker (here the `EtherFiNode`). EtherFi delegates the restaking to _Eigenlayer Node Operators_, as described in the [dependencies](#dependencies) section. This delegation can be done by any holder of the role [ETHERFI_NODE_CALL_FORWARDER_ROLE](#roleregistry-2), which includes an Externally Owner Account (EOA). Delegations and withdrawals can be made by the same role holders through Eigenlayer's `DelegationManager` using the `EtherFiNode` contract's call forwading functions.

### Ether.fan NFTs

_Ether.fans_ are NFTs minted with `ETH` that is staked exclusively with solo stakers using _Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)_. The Ether.fan NFT contract, `MembershipNFT`, is an ERC1155 with each NFT's balance being set strictly to 1. The issuance is managed by `MembershipManager`. When minted, Fans are given a random set of traits that are purely visual (gender, background, colors). These traits are stored only in offchain metadata, which can be changed by the contract administrators. The NFTs are associated with a flair depending on how much ETH is staked with them and a tier (bronze to platinum) depending on the time that has passed since they were minted. While depositing `ETH` is (currently) free of fees, depositing more than 20% in a period one month can impact the membership tier. Withdrawing `ETH` also impacts the membership tier, and withdrawing more than 50% of the all time value of the NFT will automatically burn it (withdraw the full amount). Minting is currently blocked as the limit of 10'000 mints has been reached. However, the limit can be increased by any admin of the contract.

# Dependencies

## Ethereum staking

EtherFi relies on _Node Operators_ to operate Ethereum validators. _Node Operators_ are whitelisted by EtherFi and users' funds are not in control by the _Node Operators_, as explained in the [protocol analysis](#protocol-analysis). Nonetheless, the _Node Operators_ may misbehave and lose funds due to slashing.

According to [rated](https://explorer.rated.network/o/Ether.Fi?network=mainnet&timeWindow=1d&viewBy=operator&page=1&pageSize=30&idType=pool) EtherFi has 21 different _Node Operators_ which manage the 2.5M `ETH` staked. It is worth noting that providers of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) such as SSV and Obol count as 1 operator each, but are in fact operating validators in a distributed setup, by many different independent actors. The `ETH` is not equally distributed among operators, with the biggest operator handling 177'000 `ETH`.

Each validator is linked to a `EtherFiNode` contract, and the withdrawn funds are sent to the dedicated Eigenlayer `Eigenpod` contract. The `Eigenpod` contracts implement EIP7002 which enables withdrawals to be triggered from the contracts directly. The protocol can therefore handle both validator deposits and withdrawals without relying on _Node Operators_.

## Eigenlayer

The staked `ETH` associated with `eETH` is restaked onchain using the Eigenlayer protocol. EtherFi delegates their staked `ETH` to _Eigenlayer Node Operators_, those operators can choose which _Eigenlayer AVS_ they will operate for. The possible malicious actions of those actors are described in detail in the [DeFiScan Eigenlayer report](/protocols/eigenlayer/ethereum#dependencies). Nonetheless, in the case of EtherFi, the protocol uses an older version of Eigenlayer with the following particularities:

- The _Operator_ delegate their entire stake to the _AVSs_ they operate for. In practice, this leads to their stake being "duplicated" for each _AVS_.
- The _AVSs_ cannot slash the _Operators_. As such, misbehaviour from the _AVSs_ or _Operators_ cannot lead to the _loss of user funds_. However, _loss of unclaimed yield_ remains possible as the _AVSs_ are trusted to distribute the rewards fairly and could refuse to do so.

This version of the protocol could be deprecated in the future. The contract addresses of each operator is listed in the [Eigenlayer Operators table](#eigenlayer-operators).

[To date](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/etherfi/risk/avs), the staked `ETH` is restaked through 12 _EigenLayer Node Operators_ across 17 _EigenLayer AVSs_. The funds are not equally distributed among _Operators_ and _AVSs_; the _Operator_ and _AVS_ with the highest concentrations have 17.5% and 9.9% respectively."

Each EtherFi's Ethereum validator has its withdrawal address set to a dedicated `EigenPod` contract. The `EigenPod` contracts are upgradeable by an [Eigenlayer multisig] which meets the security council requirements. Upgrading this contract could allow the multisig to trigger withdrawals and redirect the funds to an arbitrary address, leading to the _loss of user funds_.

We analysed the Eigenlayer protocol to be of Stage 0 in a [dedicated report](/protocols/eigenlayer/ethereum#dependencies). This impacts EtherFi's own score and limits it to a _Medium_ centralization risk for the _Autonomy_ dimension.

# Governance

EtherFi has no strict onchain governance. The governance token, `ETHFI`, can be used by users to vote on proposals on [Snapchot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:etherfi-dao.eth). Users can also delegate their vote and stake their governance tokens. The proposal outcomes are not enforced onchain and all operating permissions within the EtherFi protocol are held by [EOAs and multisigs](#security-council).

| EtherFiNode (Proxy) | | | |

| EtherFiNode | createEigenPod | Creates the Node's corresponging `EigenPod` using the `EigenPodManager` contract. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | setProofSubmitter | The ProofSubmitter role is an additional permission owner next to the `EigenPod` owner. This role is allowed to call `startCheckpoint`, `verifyCheckpointProofs`, `requestConsolidation` and `requestWithdrawal` functions on the `EigenPod` contract. A compromised role cannot steal funds, but disrupt the Validators activity by requesting a withdrawal. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | startCheckpoint | Starts a checkpoint to register a change of balance in order to withdraw Consensus Layer rewards, register loss of stake through slashing, or when the funds are withdrawn to the `EigenPod` from the Beacon Chain in order to withdraw the stake to a desired address. The correpsonding function in the `EigenPod` contract stores the beacon block root, the ETH balance of the `EigenPod`, and the number of validators for which a proof needs to be submitted. In a second step the `verifyCheckpointProofs` needs to be called. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | verifyCheckpointProofs | This function is called after a checkpoint is started. The function computes all the deltas of each registered validator for this EigenPod, if the delta is positive, the EigenPod receives more shares which are delegated to the current operator, if the delta is negative, the EigenPod loses shares which are delegated to the current operator. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | queueETHWithdrawal | Convenience function to queue a beaconETH withdrawal from eigenlayer. Performs the `queueWithdrawal` function with the correct params. The withdrawal is done through the Eigenlayer's `DelegationManager` contract. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | completeQueuedETHWithdrawals | Completes all queued beaconETH withdrawals that are currently claimable. If there are available rewards, they're sent to the `LiquidityPool`. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | queueWithdrawals | Queues an arbitrary withdrawal from Eigenlayer throught its `DelegationManager` contract. A set amount of time must pass before the withdrawal can be claimed used `completeQueuedWithdrawals`. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | completeQueuedWithdrawals | Completes a previous withdrawal. Simply calls the homonymous function in the `DelegationManager` contract | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | sweepFunds | Transfer any `ETH` held in the node to the `LiquidityPool`. This is not meant to be used in practice, but exists to handle exceptional cases or mistakes. | [ETHERFI_NODE_EIGENLAYER_ADMIN_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | forwardEigenPodCall | Forwards a call to the `EigenPod` contract. This function can be used to call any whitelisted function in the `EigenPod`. The `EtherFiNodesManager` contains the whitelist of allowed function calls. | [ETHERFI_NODE_CALL_FORWARDER_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |
| EtherFiNode | forwardExternalCall | Fowards a call to any arbitrary external contract. The contract and the specific function call has to be whitelisted in the `EtherFiNodesManager`. | [ETHERFI_NODE_CALL_FORWARDER_ROLE](#roleregistry-2) |

| BNFT | mint | Mints a new `BNFT`. Those NFTs are no longer used and the `StakingManager` contract's implementation no longer calls this function upon validator creation. | StakingManager |
| BNFT | burnFromWithdrawal | Burns the NFT associated with the given validator ID. Those NFTs are no longer used and the `EtherFiNodesManager` contract's implementation no longer calls this function upon validator creation. | EtherFiNodesManager |
| BNFT | burnFromCancelBNftFlow | Burns the NFT associated with the given validator ID. Those NFTs are no longer used and the `EtherFiNodesManager` contract's implementation no longer calls this function upon validator creation. | StakingManager |
| BNFT | renounceOwnership | Renounces ownership of the contract. This would set the owner to the zero address and make the contract immutable (prevent further ugprades). | EtherFiTimelock (3 Days) |
| BNFT | transferOwnership | Transfers ownership of contract to a specified address. The new owner will have the right to upgrade the contract, potentially changing its entire logic. | EtherFiTimelock (3 Days) |
| BNFT | upgradeTo | Upgrade the implementation contract. This effectively changes the logic of the contract and could also be used to reassign the ownership of all `BNFT`s already minted. | EtherFiTimelock (3 Days) |
