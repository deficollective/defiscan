# Summary

Aave v3 is a lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow different ERC20 assets. Users are able to create positions that consist of debt in different loan assets which is secured by different collateral assets. The lending market allows anyone to liquidate insolvent positions, based on an external price feed and specific collateral factors representing an asset's specific risk profile. Furthermore, instead of borrowing supplied assets, Aave V3 also issues its own stablecoin, `GHO`. Users can borrow and lend `GHO` like any other asset in the system.

The Aave DAO is Aave's onchain governance system, allowing `AAVE`, `stkAAVE` and `aAAVE` holders to govern over various aspects ranging across treasury management, risk management and strategic initiatives.
