# Summary

Ethena is a stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Ethena's stablecoin dollar, `USDe`, is fully backed by crypto assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana), yield from staked ETH through Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and funding rates earnings from short futures positions on CEXs. `USDe` is minted and redeemed by whitelisted KYCed users. Any user can acquire `USDe` on the open market and stake it to get access to yield sourced from the strategies and passed onto the users of the `USDe` stablecoin. `ENA` the governance token is freely tradeable and can be used to signal the direction of the protocol through offchain governance on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ethenagovernance.eth).

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the `USDe` stablecoin protocol deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet achieves a _Low_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

Users mint `USDe` by depositing Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana assets in the protocol. These funds make up the collateral backing of the `USDe` stablecoin and are sent to simple Ethereum (custodian) accounts (EOAs). If the accounts are not configured correctly or compromised, the `USDe` collateral backing could be lost immediately resulting in the _loss of funds_.

Minting and redemption of `USDe` is permissioned to the `MINTER` & `REDEEMER` roles which is owned by a number of Ethena Labs accounts (EOAs). No onchain guardrails exist that restrict the uncontrolled minting by a compromised account.

Third-parties have to go through KYC to be whitelisted for minting and redeeming `USDe`. The whitelist is managed by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role currently held by the [Dev Multisig](#security-council). If users are removed from the whitelist, they would have to sell any `USDe` holdings on the open market, potentially at a loss.

Users can further stake `USDe` to receive `sUSDe` and benefit from the distribution of yield generated by strategies executed on- and offchain. The `USDe` staking contract includes a blacklist feature. If a user is blacklisted, they are blocked from staking or unstaking `USDe`. Moreover, a blacklisted user's `USDe` could be seized and sent to another account or redestributed among all other stakers. Blacklisting and seizing stakers' funds require two steps that are carried out by two different permission owners, the `BLACKLIST_MANAGER_ROLE` (blacklisting) and the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (seizing), see [table](#role-permission-inside-stakedusdev2) for current role owners. If access to these accounts was lost or compromised, users' could suffer from the freezing or _loss of funds_.

Additionally, the Ethena stablecoin protocol comes with a staking contract for the the governance token `ENA`. Users can stake `ENA` to gain additionally rewards and show longterm alignment with Ethena. The `ENA` staking contract is upgradeable with permission to upgrade owned by the [Dev Multisig](#security-council). If access to these accounts was lost or compromised, users that staked their `ENA` tokens could suffer from _loss of funds_.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

As discussed, the Ethena stablecoin protocol relies on a set of offchain hedging and yield strategies to maintain full backing of the USDe stablecoin and generate yield for stakers. According to the protocol [documentation](https://docs.ethena.fi/), these offchain strategies are diversified in a number of important ways and specifically:

1. different custody providers
2. different CEXs for opening hedging positions
3. holding reserves in different spot assets (BTC, ETH, SOL)
4. different ETH staking yield sources through multiple LSTs

That said, the different services providers involved in these activities are all in full control over respective assets thus introducing critical centralization vectors.

As a result, the Ethena stablecoin protocol achieves a High centralization risk score for the Autonomy dimension.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

All permissions are not protected by an _Exit Window_ and can be executed immediately, thus could harm the users immediately. An notable exception is the minting of `ENA` tokens which can be minted only once every year.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The user interactions with the protocol can be divided into two parts: the minting and redeeming of `USDe` and the staking of `USDe`.

Users can host a frontend to mint and redeem `USDe` from https://github.com/ethena-labs/ethena-minting-client. For this action the _Accessibility_ risk is _Medium_.

For staking `USDe` the protocol does not provide a frontend to self host. The staking is only possible through the Ethena frontend. For this action the _Accessibility_ risk is _High_.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The `USDe` stablecoin protocol places custody over user funds, the assets that users are promised to redeem the `USDe` stablecoin for, in centralized custody with third-party custodians. The protocol is thus classified as **Others**.

# Protocol Analysis

![Architecture](../diagrams/Ethena.png)

## USDe Token

The owner of the `USDe` contract is the [Dev Multisig](#security-council). The [Dev Multisig](#security-council) can set any minter address, which can increase the `USDe` supply and mint `USDe` tokens to any address. The multisig is trusted to not abuse this power. The minter address is set to the `EthenaMinting` contract, which requires a transfer of accepted collateral, before minting `USDe`.

## Minting and Redeeming USDe

The Ethena stablecoin protocol allows whitelisted users to mint and redeem `USDe` through a flow that combines offchain quoting and onchain order submission with final execution by Ethena servers using EOAs with roles `MINTER_ROLE` and `REDEEMER_ROLE` (see [table](#role-permission-inside-ethenaminting)).

The process begins offchain, where a whitelisted user interacts with an Ethena-hosted pricing server to request a quote. This quote reflects the amount of collateral to be deposited and the expected `USDe` to be received. Using this information, the user constructs and signs an EIP-712 order. The signed order includes the benefactor address, collateral asset and amount of `USDe` minted.

A central server operated by the Ethena team validates this order. If the algorithms decide the order is not suitable or valid, the order is not processed or queued for later execution. Thus the users do not have inclusion guarantees for their orders. These checks do not have to be strictly enforced due to the centralized nature of compute and control, additionally the checks for global and block-level caps are strictly enforced inside the smart contract of `EthenaMinting` which prevents over-exposure to certain collateral assets and too drastic changes in collateral exposure.

If all internal checks pass, the Ethena server submits the signed order onchain by calling the `mint` or `redeem` function on the `EthenaMinting` contract. The EOAs used by the server must hold the `MINTER_ROLE` to call `mint`, or the `REDEEMER_ROLE` to call `redeem` (see [table](#role-permission-inside-ethenaminting)). On `mint`, the collateral is transferred from the whitelisted user to the `EthenaMinting` contract and `USDe` is minted into the users address by calling `mint` on the `USDe` contract. The `EthenaMinting` contract is assigned as the minter in `USDe` and is therefore the sole entity able to issue new tokens. On `redeem`, `USDe` is burned and the corresponding collateral is released to the user. No cooldown period exists for redeeming collateral for returning `USDe`.

Multiple administrative permissions exist to modify creation and burning of `USDe`. The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in `EthenaMinting` can set or change the global mint and redeem caps using `setGlobalMaxMintPerBlock` and `setGlobalMaxRedeemPerBlock`. Furthermore, the `GATEKEEPER_ROLE` may call `disableMintRedeem`, which pauses all minting and redeeming operations. This function is designed to temporary preventing further minting or redeeming in the case of a vulnerability or instability. Users that have collateral deposited and are prohibited to access their collateral can lose funds if they have to sell it in the open market if the `USDe` trades below the collateral value. Restoring minting and redeeming functionality requires setting non-zero limits via the respective `setGlobalMaxMintPerBlock` and `setGlobalMaxRedeemPerBlock` functions which only can be executed by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

The `GATEKEEPER_ROLE` may also revoke `MINTER_ROLE` and `REDEEMER_ROLE` from addresses that currently own the respective roles by calling `removeMinterRole`, `removeRedeemerRole` or `removeCollateralManagerRole`. Which is a designed security measure in case of compromised addresses.

Additionally, `removeWhitelistedBenefactor` allows the `GATEKEEPER_ROLE` to remove an address from the whitelist. Only whitelisted addresses are allowed to supply valid orders. Ethena will not accept orders from addresses that are not whitelisted, to comply with AML laws and KYC requirements, as well as anti-terrorist financing laws. If an address created a position with collateral, but got removed from the whitelist, the address has to sell the `USDe` on the open market and has no access to its deposited collateral. This could lead to _loss of funds_ for users that have collateral deposited and are removed from the whitelist if the `USDe` price drops below the collateral value.

All core permissions for minting, redeeming, managing roles, and custodial flows are ultimately under the control of [Dev Multisig](#security-council), either directly or indirectly via its ability to control `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` holders and keeps onchain authority over the `USDe` supply.

Collateral flows to custodian addresses are executed through the `transferToCustody` function, callable only by addresses with the `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE`. The destination addresses for this function can only be added or removed by holding the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Maliciously set addresses can lead to stealing collateral from users and the protocol.

## Staking USDe

Ethena enables _Stakers_ to earn yield by locking their `USDe` in the `StakedUSDeV2` contract, which issues `sUSDe` in return. This contract inherits the ERC-4626 vault standard and adds a cooldown period to complete a withdrawal. Users deposit `USDe` and receive `sUSDe` at a ratio determined by total vault assets and total shares. Yield earned by the vault is reflected as an increase in the value of each `sUSDe` share.

The `StakedUSDeV2` contract implements a cooldown period, _Stakers_ must wait 7 days to complete a withdrawal. After the cooldown the `USDe` can be withdrawn by calling `withdraw` which transfers `USDe` from the `USDeSilo` contract to the _Staker_. The cooldown period is configurable by calling `setCooldownDuration` and is capped at 90 days max.

The `StakedUSDeV2` contract also includes a blacklist mechanism managed by addresses holding the `BLACKLIST_MANAGER_ROLE`. If a user is blacklisted, they are prevented from staking or unstaking `USDe`. This could result in _loss of funds_ if users are unable to retrieve their staked assets and and if they have to sell `sUSDe` on the open market at a discount. It can lead to a complete _loss of funds_ if their `sUSDe` is burned from their wallet and redistributed to other _Stakers_ via the `redistributeLockedAmount` function, which is controlled by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

Yield from the various strategies is transferred into the system via the `StakingRewardsDistributor` contract. The `StakingRewardsDistributor` contract holds `USDe` rewards and regularly calls `transferInRewards` to transfer them into `StakedUSDeV2`. The `StakingRewardsDistributor` is operated by an address labeled [Operator](#security-council), which is itself appointed by the [Dev Multisig](#security-council). While the [Operator](#security-council) can delay transfers, they cannot redirect funds or change the recipient. This minimizes the risk of _loss of unclaimed yield_, though misconfiguration or inaction may still delay yield distribution. The [Dev Multisig](#security-council) can replace the [Operator](#security-council) to prevent _loss of unclaimed yield_ at any time.

The ability to rescue tokens from the vault, handled by `rescueTokens`, is restricted to addresses with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Although this function cannot extract `USDe`, it can affect other tokens accidentally sent to the vault.

# Dependencies

`USDe` is only slightly overcollateralized and relies on various strategies to maintain stability and peg to the US-Dollar. The strategies rely on various counterparties to function correctly. If any of the counterparties fail, the solvency of the protocol is at risk. Ethena has a [Reserve Fund](#security-council) to provide a buffer in case of negative performance of the diversified yield strategies. Ethena employs diversification within each strategy by relying on various counterparties and tokens as well as diversify in different strategies. The following paragraphs go into more detail.

## CEXs

The Ethena `USDe` Stablecoin protocol relies on centralized exchanges (CEXs) for maintaining short perpetual positions to create a delta neutral strategy.

The CEXs that are used by Ethena `USDe` protocol include Binance, OKX, Deribit and Bybit. By splitting opening short perpetuals on multiple CEXs, Ethena can reduce the risk of a single exchange failure.

## Custodians (Off-Exchange Settlement)

Ethena holds the backing assets used in CEXs for perpetual positions in custody with "Off-Exchange Settlement" solutions which allows to delegate funds to the CEX trades without transferring the assets to the CEX. The funds only flow for settlement of PnL and paying funding rate. For example, via Copper Clearloop this happens daily to prevent accumulation of unsettled profit/loss. In case of an exchange failure, Ethena should be able to delegate the funds to other exchanges to continue the strategy.

OES providers that Ethena uses as mentioned include Copper, Ceffu and Fireblocks.

## Centralized Stablecoins

Ethena allocates parts of their collateral funds into `USDC` to earn yield distributed by Coinbase. Ethena therefore relies on Circle as Stablecoin issuer and on Coinbase custody.

## Backing Assets

Ethena holds `BTC`, `ETH`, `SOL` and ETH `LSTs` as collateral for the `USDe` stablecoin. To reduce dependency risk on a single `LST`, Ethena diversifies their collateral assets into [Binance Staked ETH (WBETH)](../binance-staked-eth/ethereum.md), [Lido stETH](../lido-v2/ethereum.md) and Mantle's mETH.

## Margin Collateral

Most of the margin in perpetual futures positions are denominated in `USDT`. By this, Ethena is unidirectionally LONG exposed to the `USDT` price without offsetting with short exposure. In case of indicated solvency risk, custodial risk, regulatory risk for `USDT`, Ethena would aim to open inverse perpetuals contracts, margined with `BTC` or `ETH`.

## USDtb

`USDtb` is an asset in the [Reserve Fund](#security-council) to provide a buffer in case of negative performance of the diversified yield strategy. `USDtb` is a separate project from the `USDe` stablecoin, but is also created and managed by the Ethena Team. `USDtb` is backed by short duration treasury assets inside the BlackRock's BUIDL fund. tb inside USDtb stands for "Treasury Bills".

# Governance

Ethena governance using the `ENA` token is purely used for signalling and is not technically enforcing. Holders of `ENA` can participate in offchain voting via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ethenagovernance.eth), where they may submit and vote on proposals related to risk parameters, vault configurations, supported collateral, and other protocol adjustments.

Votes cast on Snapshot are technically not binding. Their outcomes inform the Ethena Labs Team and the Risk Committee, who are responsible for executing changes onchain through controlled permission owners like the [Dev Multisig](#security-council), the other multisigs and EOAs listed in the tables [here](#role-permission-inside-ethenaminting). The Risk Committee consists of selected individuals or entities elected by the Ethena Labs Team.

The `ENA` token itself is governed by the [Dev Multisig](#security-council), which holds exclusive access to the mint function. Token minting is constrained to a maximum of 10% annually and can only occur once every year. The ownership of `ENA` is transferable via `transferOwnership`.

Ultimately _Governance_ execution remains under centralized control.

This function changes the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` which has the privilege to appoint roles to manage `StakedENA` or to directly manage this contract by calling `updateVestingPeriod`, `rescueTokens` or `redistributeLockedAmount`. Thus the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` has the privilege to assign a `BLACKLIST_MANAGER_ROLE` and consecutively redirect the blacklisted funds to a desired address.                                                                | DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE                                   |
| StakedENA (Implementation)              | acceptAdmin                 | Transferring `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is a two-step process in which the recipient of the role needs to confirm the new role.
