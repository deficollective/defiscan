# Summary

Euler V2 is a permissioned, decentralized lending and borrowing protocol deployed on Ethereum. It allows users to deposit assets as collateral, borrow against them, and earn interest via an on-chain interest rate model. The protocol employs smart contracts such as EVaults, a generic factory, and a router to handle asset flows, and integrates with oracles and governance modules to manage risk and updates.

# Ratings

## Chain

Euler V2 is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The Euler V2 protocol can be analyzed in a number of logical modules: _Factory-Level Bytecode Upgrades_, _Per-Vault Parameter Control_, _Oracle System_, _Fee Configuration_, _EulerEarn Vault System_, and _EulerSwap_. These modules contain permissioned functions that could result in the _theft or loss of user funds_, _loss of unclaimed yield_, or otherwise _materially affect the expected performance_ of the protocol. The control vectors are distributed across the DAO multisig (4/8), FactoryGovernor contract, Euler Labs multisig (2/6), vault-specific governors, and various role-based permissions.

### Factory-Level Bytecode Upgrades

The `GenericFactory` contract's `setImplementation` function upgrades the implementation logic for all BeaconProxy vaults simultaneously. Each BeaconProxy queries the factory's `implementation()` function on every call to fetch the current EVault address. The `FactoryGovernor` holds exclusive authority over this function, protected by a 4-day timelock through the eVaultFactoryTimelockController. The factory also exposes `setUpgradeAdmin` to transfer complete factory control.

### Per-Vault Parameter Control

Each EVault stores a `governorAdmin` address controlling vault-specific parameters through functions including `setGovernorAdmin`, `setFeeReceiver`, `setLTV`, `setMaxLiquidationDiscount`, `setLiquidationCoolOffTime`, `setInterestRateModel`, `setHookConfig`, `setConfigFlags`, `setCaps`, and `setInterestFee`. DAO-managed vaults route these permissions through `GovernorAccessControlEmergency` with 48-hour timelock delays via AdminTimelock and WildcardTimelock. Private vault creators can assign governance to an EOA or multisig for direct control. The `CapRiskSteward` multisig (3/5) holds emergency roles that bypass the 48-hour timelock for immediate risk-reducing actions.

### Oracle System

Each `EulerRouter` has independent governance controlling `govSetConfig`, `govSetResolvedVault`, and `govSetFallbackOracle`, which configure price oracles for asset pairs. The `SnapshotRegistry` (oracleAdapterRegistry) maintained by Euler Labs whitelists approved oracle adapters through `add` and `revoke` functions.

### Fee Configuration

The `ProtocolConfig` contract controls global fee settings through `setProtocolFeeShare`, `setInterestFeeRange`, and vault-specific overrides, which affect all existing user positions immediately. Per-vault fee configuration is available through `setFeeReceiver` and `setInterestFee` on individual EVaults.

### EulerEarn Vault System

EulerEarn vaults implement role-based permissions where the vault owner controls `setCurator`, `setIsAllocator`, `setFee`, and `setFeeRecipient`. The curator manages strategy selection through `submitCap` and `submitMarketRemoval`. Allocators control fund distribution via `reallocate`, `setSupplyQueue`, and `updateWithdrawQueue`. The `EulerEarnFactory2` exposes `setPerspective` to update strategy validation rules for all EulerEarn vaults.

### EulerSwap

The `EulerSwapFactory` controls swap fee configuration through `setProtocolFee` and `setProtocolFeeRecipient` for all EulerSwap pools.

With the current setup, the timelock protections (48-hour and 4-day delays) fall below the 7-day minimum threshold required for medium risk classification, and numerous critical functions affecting user funds can be executed by multisigs or role holders.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

Euler V2 relies on external oracle providers selected by vault creators and risk curators for all price data required for collateral valuations and liquidation decisions. Vault creators are free to choose appropriate price oracle implementations from various providers including Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Uniswap V3, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv, thus delegating responsibility to individual actors.

The protocol employs CrossAdapters that derive prices through sequential multiplication of two external oracles sharing a base or quote asset. These create dependency chains where the failure of either component oracle causes complete price feed failure. For ERC-4626 vault collaterals, the system depends on external vaults' `convertToAssets()` functions, which may be vulnerable to manipulation if those vaults lack adequate protections.

Pull-based oracles like Pyth introduce operational dependencies where transactions can fail if price updates are not fetched within the 2-3 minute validity window. Observable errors include intermittent failures when querying vault data and operations failing unpredictably based on timing, highlighting the practical risks of external oracle dependencies.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Euler V2 implements timelock mechanisms for some governance functions but lacks comprehensive exit window protection for critical operations. While the protocol uses TimelockController contracts with 48-hour and 4-day delays for certain administrative functions, many critical permissions can be executed immediately without any delay.

The most critical function that bypasses exit windows entirely is the `setImplementation` function of the `GenericFactory` contract which can immediately upgrade the implementation for all upgradeable vaults (those deployed as beacon proxies) across the protocol. However, this only affects vaults that were created with the upgradeable flag set to true, not immutable vaults (minimal proxies).

Additionally, numerous other functions can be executed immediately without delay, including the `pause` function of the `FactoryGovernor` contract which can freeze all vault operations instantly, vault parameter functions like the `setLTV`, `setInterestRateModel` functions of the `EVault` contract that can be modified without delay by vault governors, and protocol-wide configuration functions like the `setProtocolFeeShare` function of the `ProtocolConfig` contract which can redirect all yield to attackers and oracle configuration functions like the `govSetConfig` function of the `EulerRouter` contract which can switch to compromised oracles from the approved registry.

The limited timelock protections (48-hour and 4-day delays) apply only to a subset of administrative functions and fall well below the 7-day minimum threshold required for medium risk classification.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Users can only access Euler V2 through a single user interface: app.euler.finance. Currently, there is no backup solution in case the interface is shut down or users are censored.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

Euler V2 receives a _Low centralization risk_ score for _Chain_, and _High centralization risk_ scores for _Upgradeability_, _Autonomy_, _Exit Window_, and _Accessibility_ dimensions.

The protocol exposes critical permissions for factory-wide bytecode upgrades and per-vault parameter control that are protected with timelock delays of only 48 hours and 4 days, falling below the 7-day minimum threshold. Furthermore, Euler V2 is exposed to centralization risks from its external oracle dependencies, where vault creators select from multiple providers including Chainlink, Pyth, and RedStone without protocol-level fallback mechanisms to mitigate price feed failures.

Euler V2 thus achieves _Stage 0_.

The protocol could reach _Stage 1_ by: 1) extending timelock protections to at least 7 days for all critical permissions, Or 2) establishing a Security Council with at least 7 signers, at least 51% threshold, at least 50% non-insider signers, and publicly announced signers with ownership of or veto power over critical permissions, And 3) implementing fallback mechanisms for oracle dependencies, And 4) publishing the frontend code to IPFS or developing alternative interfaces.

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Reviewer's Notes

⚠️ Analysis of on-chain deployment events reveals that all observed EVault instances are deployed as upgradeable BeaconProxies. No immutable MinimalProxy deployments were identified in the examined sample, despite the factory supporting both deployment modes. This means all analyzed vaults remain subject to factory-wide implementation upgrades via `setImplementation`, which can affect all vault logic simultaneously through the 4-day timelock.

⚠️ Pull-based oracles like Pyth introduce operational dependencies where transactions can fail if price updates are not fetched within the 2-3 minute validity window. Observable errors include intermittent failures when querying vault data and operations failing unpredictably based on timing. Users and integrators must implement price update mechanisms in their transaction batches to avoid reverts.

⚠️ The OFTAdapterUpgradeable proxy (cross-chain EUL bridge) at [0x4d7e09f73843Bd4735AaF7A74b6d877bac75a531](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d7e09f73843Bd4735AaF7A74b6d877bac75a531) has its `initialize()` function disabled, making all permissioned functions (setMsgInspector, setEnforcedOptions, setPeer, setDelegate) permanently inaccessible. The current configuration is immutable and cannot be updated even during emergencies.

# Protocol Analysis

## Core Architecture and EVC Mediation

Euler V2 implements a modular vault-based lending architecture centered around two foundational contracts: the [EthereumVaultConnector (EVC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C9a3dd6b8F28529d72d7f9cE918D493519EE383) and the [GenericFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29a56a1b8214D9Cf7c5561811750D5cBDb45CC8e). The `EVC` serves as an immutable authentication layer mediating all interactions between users and vaults, while the `GenericFactory` enables permissionless creation of isolated lending markets. Each vault functions as an ERC-4626 compliant tokenized debt market for a specific underlying asset, maintaining full compatibility with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

### Vault Creation and Deployment 

Vault creation begins when any user calls `createProxy` on the `GenericFactory`, which deploys a new vault instance as either a BeaconProxy or MinimalProxy that delegates all function execution to the standardized [EVault (Implementation)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8Ff1C814719096b61aBf00Bb46EAd0c9A529Dd7D) via delegatecall. The BeaconProxy queries the GenericFactory's `implementation()` function on every call to fetch the current EVault address, enabling factory-wide upgrades through a single `setImplementation` transaction. This proxy architecture separates code logic from data storage: EVault contains the reusable function code shared across all vaults, while each proxy stores its own independent state including the governorAdmin address, user balances, collateral configurations, and vault parameters. The factory supports two deployment patterns: when `upgradeable=true`, it deploys a `BeaconProxy` allowing authorized governance to upgrade all vault implementations simultaneously; when `upgradeable=false`, it deploys an immutable `MinimalProxy` whose logic cannot be changed. Analysis of on-chain events reveals predominantly upgradeable `BeaconProxy` deployments, with no immutable `MinimalProxy` instances observed in the examined sample.

During initialization, the newly created vault automatically registers itself with the `EthereumVaultConnector`, establishing itself as a recognized entity within the `EVC`'s authentication framework. The vault simultaneously creates an associated `DToken` contract, an ERC-20 compliant debt token that represents borrowed positions and makes debt modifications visible in block explorers and tax accounting software. The vault creator specifies critical parameters including the underlying asset, oracle router, interest rate model, and governance settings. Once deployed, the vault operates as an independent lending market with its own collateral configuration and risk parameters.

### Factory-Level Governance

Control over the `GenericFactory` operates through the [FactoryGovernor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2F13256E04022d6356d8CE8C53C7364e13DC1f3d), which holds exclusive authority to call `setImplementation` and upgrade the beacon implementation address for all `BeaconProxy` vaults simultaneously. The `FactoryGovernor` can also execute `setUpgradeAdmin` to transfer factory control to a different address.

All critical factory operations are protected by a mandatory 4-day timelock through the [eVaultFactoryTimelockController](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968), providing users with advance notice before any upgrade takes effect. The factory also implements emergency pause functionality through the `FactoryGovernor`, which can immediately freeze all vault operations by replacing the factory implementation with a read-only proxy. The complete governance structure, including proposal mechanisms, role assignments, and emergency controls, is detailed in the [Governance](#governance) section.

### Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC)

The `EthereumVaultConnector` functions as the mandatory entry point for all vault interactions in Euler V2, serving as an immutable authentication and coordination layer with no governance or upgrade mechanisms. The `EVC` mediates every deposit, withdrawal, borrow, and liquidation operation, enabling vaults to trust that calls originating from the `EVC` are properly authenticated and authorized. This architecture ensures vault logic remains simple and modular while complex authentication, batching, and cross-vault coordination are handled by the centralized but trustless `EVC` contract.

The `EVC` provides each user address with 256 virtual sub-accounts for position isolation. These sub-accounts enable users to manage multiple isolated trading strategies, separate high-risk positions from conservative holdings, and implement sophisticated risk management frameworks without deploying separate wallet contracts. Each sub-account can independently enable or disable collateral and controller vaults, allowing users to compartmentalize their exposure across different lending markets.

The `EVC` enables atomic batching of operations through its `batch` function, which executes multiple calls in a single transaction while deferring solvency and cap checks until completion. This functionality allows users to open leveraged positions, rebalance collateral across vaults, execute flash loans with automatic repayment, and combine lending, borrowing, and swapping operations without intermediate states that would violate solvency requirements. The `EVC` also provides two emergency modes for user protection: `Lockdown Mode` restricts all operations except operator management and nonce updates, while `Permit Disabled Mode` prevents execution of any permits signed by the owner. The `EVC`'s operator delegation system allows users to authorize trusted contracts to act on behalf of their sub-accounts, enabling automated strategies, limit orders, and third-party integrations while maintaining user custody.

## Lending, Borrowing and Liquidation

### Deposit and Withdrawal Process

Users deposit assets into `EVaults` through the `EthereumVaultConnector`, which serves as the mandatory entry point for all vault operations. When a user calls `batch` on the `EVC` with encoded deposit instructions, the `EVC` authenticates the caller, forwards the request to the target `EVault`, and executes the deposit operation atomically.

The `EVault` receives the underlying asset and mints vault shares. As interest accrues from borrowers, the value of each share increases proportionally, distributing yield to all depositors automatically. Each `EVault` maintains internal balance tracking to prevent manipulation through external transfers or balance inflation attacks.

Withdrawals mirror deposits in reverse. Users call `batch` on the `EVC` with withdrawal instructions specifying the amount and receiver address. The `EVault` burns the corresponding vault shares and transfers the underlying assets. The `EVC` defers all solvency checks until the end of the batch.

### Cross-Vault Borrowing and Collateralization

Euler V2 enables borrowing from one vault using collateral from another through the EVC's cross-vault system. Users must call `enableCollateral` on the EVC to designate collateral sources, then `enableController` to authorize the borrow vault to enforce solvency and control collateral during liquidations.

The controller designation grants privileged access via `controlCollateral`. Only vaults explicitly enabled as controllers can invoke this function through the EVC, preventing unauthorized access. Users can isolate strategies across their 256 sub-accounts, each with independent collateral and controller configurations.

When borrowing, the EVC authenticates and forwards the request to the borrow vault. The vault queries the EVC for total collateral value and compares it against the requested amount multiplied by the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Euler V2 implements three LTV thresholds: Borrow LTV sets maximum leverage, Liquidation LTV defines the liquidation threshold, and Spread LTV creates a buffer zone preventing immediate liquidation. The vault governor configures these thresholds through `setLTV`.

The borrow vault mints `DToken`, an ERC-20 debt tracking token that emits Transfer events via `emitTransfer` for visibility in block explorers. DTokens function as read-only interfaces without permitting direct transfers. Debt compounds automatically every second via the vault's Interest Rate Model. The EVC calls `checkAccountStatus` on all controller vaults at batch end, reverting if any check fails.

### Interest Rate Models

Each EVault configures an Interest Rate Model (IRM) at deployment that dynamically adjusts borrowing costs based on utilization. The `EulerKinkIRMFactory` creates linear kink models with piecewise-linear curves, the `EulerIRMAdaptiveCurveFactory` deploys adaptive models based on historical trends, and the `EulerFixedCyclicalBinaryIRMFactory` produces fixed-rate cyclical models. The vault governor selects and modifies the IRM via `setInterestRateModel`.

Interest accrues deterministically every second using exponential compounding with rates expressed as "second percent yield" (SPY) values scaled by 1e27. Higher utilization triggers higher rates, incentivizing deposits or debt repayment. A configurable portion flows to fees through the `interestFee` parameter, with ProtocolConfig determining the split between vault governor and Euler DAO treasury. The vault governor configures this fee distribution through `setInterestFee`.

### Liquidation Mechanism

Positions become eligible for liquidation when collateral value falls below the Liquidation LTV threshold multiplied by outstanding debt. Euler V2 implements a reverse Dutch auction where the discount scales proportionally with violation depth. Slightly underwater positions offer minimal discounts, while deeper violations increase the discount progressively until liquidation becomes economically attractive.

Liquidators call `batch` on the EVC with a liquidate instruction. The borrow vault calculates the liquidatable amount and collateral seizure based on the current discount, capped by `maxLiquidationDiscount`. The borrow vault invokes `controlCollateral` on the EVC with the collateral vault address, violator's account, and transfer calldata. The EVC authenticates the controller authority and executes the transfer.

The liquidator receives vault shares at a discounted valuation. The borrow vault calls `emitTransfer` on the DToken to record the debt reduction. The `liquidationCoolOffTime` parameter prevents immediate liquidation after position creation. When bad debt socialization is enabled, insufficient collateral positions have their remaining liabilities distributed across all depositors by reducing the share exchange rate. The vault governor configures these liquidation parameters through `setMaxLiquidationDiscount` and `setLiquidationCoolOffTime`.

![Lending Borrowing Liquidation Cycle](../diagrams/Euler_v2_Lending_Borrowing_Liquidation_Cycle.png)

## Oracle System and Price Feeds

### Modular Oracle Architecture

Euler V2 implements a vendor-agnostic oracle system through the [EulerRouterFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70B3f6F61b7Bf237DF04589DdAA842121072326A), enabling permissionless creation of independent oracle routers. Each router instance, such as [EulerRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ab93f4ee16fb9c0086651a85f941b8a8716cd57), has its own governor and configuration. The architecture combines immutable Adapters implementing ERC-7726 IPriceOracle interface with configurable Routers dispatching vault price queries. Vault creators specify an oracle router address during deployment, which becomes immutable. Vaults call `getQuote(inAmount, base, quote)` on their router, which dispatches to registered adapters and returns price data.

### Oracle Adapters and Providers

Oracle Adapters are immutable contracts translating external data into ERC-7726 format. Active integrations include Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Uniswap V3, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv. The system supports push-based oracles like Chainlink with automatic updates, and pull-based oracles like Pyth requiring users to submit fresh data. CrossAdapters derive prices through sequential multiplication of two sources, while ERC-4626 adapters query `convertToAssets()` for share valuations.

### Oracle Registry and Validation

The [SnapshotRegistry (oracleAdapterRegistry)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA084A7F49723E3cc5722E052CF7fce910E7C5Fe6) maintains approved adapters. Routers verify adapter approval before dispatching queries. [Euler Labs](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB1345E7A4D35FB3E6bF22A32B3741Ae74E5Fba27) controls the registry via `add` and `revoke`. Each router has independent governance controlling `govSetConfig`, `govSetResolvedVault`, and `govSetFallbackOracle`, separate from vault governance.

![Oracle System and Price Feeds](../diagrams/Euler_v2_Oracle_System_and_Price_Feeds.png)

## Governance, Timelocks and Permissions

Euler V2 implements a multi-layered governance architecture with per-vault governance, factory-level upgrades, and global configuration via [ProtocolConfig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4cD6BF1D183264c02Be7748Cb5cd3A47d013351b). The [DAO multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe) (4/8 threshold) operates through three TimelockController contracts: 48-hour [AdminTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59) for role management, 48-hour [WildcardTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a) for parameter adjustments, and 4-day [FactoryTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968) for protocol upgrades.

### Per-Vault Governance Structure

Each vault stores a `governorAdmin` address controlling vault-specific parameters (LTV ratios, interest rate models, caps, hooks, fees) via `governorOnly` protected functions. DAO-managed vaults use [GovernorAccessControlEmergency](https://etherscan.io/address/0x35400831044167E9E2DE613d26515eeE37e30a1b) as `governorAdmin`, enforcing 48-hour timelock delays. Private vaults can use an EOA or multisig for direct control without delays.

### Risk Management and Stewards

[CapRiskSteward](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFE56cAa36DA676364e1a0a97e4f7C07651e89B95) enables optimistic risk management within safety constraints. The [riskSteward multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBdAa3FCc9983bD72feE0F7D017e02673896a976d) (3/5 threshold) modifies caps with 24-hour cooldown, allowing 2x increases or 0.5x decreases per period, and updates interest rate models deployed by `EulerKinkIRMFactory`. `CapRiskSteward` holds selector-specific roles on `GovernorAccessControlEmergency`, bypassing the 48-hour timelock while bound by contract-enforced limits.

### Emergency Controls

`GovernorAccessControlEmergency` implements three emergency roles for immediate risk reduction: `LTV_EMERGENCY_ROLE` (held by `CapRiskSteward`) lowers borrow LTV while maintaining liquidation LTV, `CAPS_EMERGENCY_ROLE` (held by `CapRiskSteward`) reduces caps immediately, and `HOOK_EMERGENCY_ROLE` (unassigned) would pause vault operations. Emergency powers are strictly risk-reducing. Recovery requires normal governance through WildcardTimelock. The DAO and [Euler Labs](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB1345E7A4D35FB3E6bF22A32B3741Ae74E5Fba27) hold `CANCELLER_ROLE` on both timelocks, enabling proposal cancellation during delays.

![Governance Timelocks and Permissions](../diagrams/Euler_v2_Governance_Timelocks_and_Permissions.png)

## Advanced Modules
### Tokens & Rewards System

The [`EUL`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd9Fcd98c322942075A5C3860693e9f4f03AAE07b) contract minted 27,182,818 tokens at deployment to the [Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25Aa4a183800EcaB962d84ccC7ada58d4e126992). The Treasury holds `ADMIN_ROLE` and can call `mint()` once every 365 days to create 2.718% of total supply. The `mintingRestrictedBefore` variable enforces this interval. The Treasury transfers `EUL` to the [DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe), which allocates tokens to [Euler Labs](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB1345E7A4D35FB3E6bF22A32B3741Ae74E5Fba27) for rEUL rewards.

### rEUL Rewards System

The [`rEUL`](https://etherscan.io/address/0exf3e621395fc714B90dA337AA9108771597b4E696) token is a locked form of `EUL` incentivizing protocol adoption. Merkl calculates rewards every 8-12 hours off-chain. When users claim, Euler Labs calls `depositFor(account, amount)` on the rEUL contract, which transfers `EUL` from Euler Labs to the rEUL contract and mints corresponding rEUL for the user.

### Balance Forwarding and Reward Distribution

The protocol implements a balance forwarding system through the [TrackingRewardStreams](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D52d06ceB8Dcdeeb40Cfd9f17489B350dD7F8a3) contract, enabling instant and trustless distribution of rewards while keeping gas costs low. When an account opts in via `enableBalanceForwarder`, every balance change in the vault triggers a notification to the TrackingRewardStreams contract. This mechanism allows external reward distributors like Merkl to track user positions in real-time and calculate proportional reward allocations off-chain. The system maintains accuracy without requiring on-chain snapshot mechanisms or manual claim updates, reducing operational overhead for both users and reward distributors.

### Vesting Mechanism

rEUL converts to `EUL` at 1:1 ratio over six months: 20% unlocks immediately, 80% linearly over 180 days. Early redemption forfeits the locked portion to [`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD) (configured as `remainderReceiver`). Each rEUL transfer starts a distinct unlock schedule, making each batch non-fungible despite its ERC-20 interface.

![Token Rewards System](../diagrams/Euler_v2_Token_Rewards_System.png)

### Multiply Strategies (Leverage Looping)

Multiply strategies automate leveraged position creation through the [`EthereumVaultConnector`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C9a3dd6b8F28529d72d7f9cE918D493519EE383). Users initiate a `batch()` transaction that deposits collateral into an `EVault`, borrows against it from a debt `EVault`, swaps the borrowed asset via [`Swapper`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2Bba09866b6F1025258542478C39720A09B728bF) (verified by [`SwapVerifier`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae26485ACDDeFd486Fe9ad7C2b34169d360737c7)), and redeposits the result as collateral. This loop repeats until reaching the target multiplier. The EVC defers liquidity checks until batch completion, then validates position health via `checkAccountStatus()`.

When a position's health score drops to ≤1, liquidators can call `liquidate()` through the EVC. The debt `EVault` verifies eligibility and invokes `controlCollateral()` on the EVC to seize collateral at a discount proportional to the position's unhealthiness (reverse Dutch auction). The seized collateral transfers to the liquidator, who repays the corresponding debt. All positions and debt are stored in the respective EVaults.

![Multiply Strategies](../diagrams/Euler_v2_Multiply_Strategies.png)

## EulerEarn System

### Vault Deployment

EulerEarn implements a yield aggregation layer through factory-deployed proxy contracts. Observed deployment shows [Address 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95058F3d4C69F14f6125ad4602E925845BD5d6A4) calling `createEulerEarn` on [EulerEarnFactory2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x59709B029B140C853FE28d277f83C3a65e308aF4), specifying the underlying asset, vault name and symbol, initial owner address, and timelock duration. The factory deploys a proxy contract via CREATE2 that delegates all calls to the shared [EulerEarn Implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa42141648dFD74388f3541C1d80fa9387043Da9).

Each proxy maintains independent storage including role addresses, approved strategies, per-strategy caps, and user balances, while the implementation contains shared function code. During initialization, the contract assigns ownership to the specified `initialOwner` and configures the initial timelock to zero seconds.

The deployer performs immediate setup: `setSupplyQueue` to configure strategy ordering, `submitGuardian` to designate the guardian address, `submitTimelock` to establish security delays, then `transferOwnership` to transfer control to the [DAO multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe).

### Role-Based Permissions

EulerEarn implements a four-level permission hierarchy via Ownable2Step:

**Owner** holds supreme authority over all vault parameters. The Owner can call `setCurator` to define who approves strategies, `setIsAllocator` to authorize or revoke allocators, `submitGuardian` to propose a new guardian, `setFee` to adjust performance fees between 0% and 50%, `setFeeRecipient` to direct revenue destination, and `submitTimelock` to modify security delays. The Owner can execute any function available to other roles.

**Curator** controls strategy selection via `submitCap` to set per-strategy supply caps. Cap increases require timelock approval; decreases execute immediately. `submitMarketRemoval` initiates strategy removal from withdrawal queues after reducing caps to zero. Maximum 30 strategies per vault.

**Allocator** executes rebalancing operations via `reallocate` to move funds between strategies within cap limits, `setSupplyQueue` to reorder deposit allocation priority, and `updateWithdrawQueue` to configure withdrawal ordering. Multiple allocators can be authorized simultaneously, enabling operational decentralization or automation via contracts.

**Guardian** exercises veto power via `revokePendingTimelock`, `revokePendingGuardian`, `revokePendingCap`, and `revokePendingMarketRemoval`, functioning as a circuit-breaker for timelocked actions.

Certain functions accept multiple roles: `setSupplyQueue`, `updateWithdrawQueue`, and `reallocate` accept Allocator, Curator, or Owner. `revokePendingCap` and `revokePendingMarketRemoval` accept Curator, Guardian, or Owner.

### User Deposits and Withdrawals

Users deposit assets via standard ERC-4626 interface. The vault mints shares proportional to current vault value and allocates deposits according to the supply queue, respecting per-strategy caps. Each strategy corresponds to an underlying EVault eligible to receive allocations up to its individual cap.

Yield accrues automatically as underlying EVaults generate lending interest. Share value increases proportionally to aggregated yield. Performance fees (if configured) are charged only on positive yield and minted as shares to the fee recipient address.

Withdrawals execute according to the withdrawal queue. The vault attempts redemption from strategies in configured order. If a strategy lacks liquidity or reverts, the vault continues with the next strategy. Liquidity availability depends on underlying strategy conditions.

The [PublicAllocator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x533f8D1a0bf97C2ea0eDf27Db808e5776e8FbEfA) enables permissionless optimistic rebalancing in certain vaults, allowing any address to trigger reallocations within cap constraints.

## EulerSwap System

### Pool Deployment

EulerSwap implements a capital-efficient AMM through factory-deployed meta-proxy contracts. Any user can create a pool by calling `deployPool` on [EulerSwapFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb013be1D0D380C13B58e889f412895970A2Cf228), specifying two EVault addresses, AMM curve parameters, and their Euler account address. The factory deploys a meta-proxy via CREATE2 pointing to the shared [EulerSwap Implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc35a0FDA69e9D71e68C0d9CBb541Adfd21D6B117), encoding parameters directly into bytecode for immutability and gas efficiency.

During activation, the pool approves both EVaults for transfers, enables them as collateral through the `EVC`, and registers in the factory's pool registry. Deployment restricts `_msgSender()` to match the account owner, ensuring only authorized pool creation.

### Single-Owner Pool Model

Each EulerSwap pool is controlled by a single Euler account. The owner deposits assets into underlying EVaults (`EVault Token A` and `EVault Token B`), which simultaneously earn lending interest, serve as swap liquidity, and enable borrowing. The owner installs the pool as an authorized operator via the `EVC`, granting withdrawal and deposit permissions during swaps.

### Just-in-Time (JIT) Liquidity

When swaps require more output tokens than available reserves, EulerSwap automatically borrows the shortfall from the corresponding EVault using incoming input tokens as collateral. This operates through `FundsLib.withdrawAssets()`, which first withdraws available balance, then calls `enableController` and executes `borrow` if needed. Subsequently, `FundsLib.depositAssets()` deposits received input tokens, automatically repaying debt and disabling the controller at zero debt.

This architecture can simulate up to 50x liquidity depth in optimal conditions, particularly for low-volatility pairs. A pool with $20,000 reserves can service trades requiring $1,000,000 in traditional AMMs.

### Trading Execution

Traders initiate swaps via [EulerSwapPeriphery](https://etherscan.io/address/0x208fF5Eb543814789321DaA1B5Eb551881D16b06), which queries EVault balances, calculates routing, and forwards requests to the pool. The pool optimistically transfers output tokens, invokes callbacks for flash swaps, then deposits input tokens with fee deductions. [SwapVerifier](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae26485ACDDeFd486Fe9ad7C2b34169d360737c7) validates slippage constraints and curve compliance.

### Protocol Fees

The DAO controls global protocol fees via `setProtocolFee` and `setProtocolFeeRecipient` on the factory. During swaps, `FundsLib.depositAssets()` deducts the protocol fee portion and transfers it to the designated recipient. Remaining fees accrue to the pool owner's collateral, compounding with lending interest and protocol rewards.

## Data Access and Lens Contracts

Euler V2 provides comprehensive data access through specialized lens contracts that aggregate and expose protocol state for efficient querying. These read-only contracts enable developers, analytics platforms, and user interfaces to retrieve account positions, vault states, and oracle prices without executing complex multi-call operations.

The [AccountLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94B9D29721f0477402162C93d95B3b4e52425844) aggregates user account data across multiple vaults and sub-accounts, providing consolidated views of positions, collateral, and debt. The [VaultLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65C7ac387A45d7b4709166784BB431A58Bc59eB) exposes vault-specific information including total supply, borrow rates, utilization, and caps. The [OracleLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C47736aaBEE757AB8C8F60776741e39DBf3F183) facilitates price queries across multiple asset pairs through configured oracle routers. The [IRMLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57B1BB683b109eB0F1e6d9043067C86F0C6c52C1) retrieves interest rate model parameters and projected rates, while the [UtilsLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB8cac3e5CaaC2042B79938aFe7FEA3f44e5afcC1) provides utility functions for batch operations and data formatting.

Additional specialized lenses include [EulerEarnVaultLens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xafad3c14f32BD46EB32F7383214f4Af0Cff6285f) for EulerEarn vault analytics and strategy allocation data. The modular lens architecture enables efficient off-chain data indexing and analytics while maintaining compatibility with standard web3 libraries and block explorers.

# Dependencies

## Oracles

Euler V2 employs a vendor-agnostic oracle system supporting multiple price feed providers selected by vault creators and risk curators. The system operates through a modular architecture combining immutable Adapters that interface with external oracles and convert data to standardized ERC-7726 format, and configurable Routers that dispatch price queries.

The protocol distinguishes between push-based oracles like Chainlink that automatically update prices at regular intervals, and pull-based oracles like Pyth that require manual price updates with 2-3 minute validity periods. Analysis of Euler's Oracle Dashboard reveals active usage across multiple providers, with Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv representing the primary external dependencies chosen by individual vault creators.

The system also employs CrossAdapters that derive prices through sequential multiplication of two oracles sharing a common asset. For example, wstETH/USD pricing is derived by chaining wstETH/stETH and stETH/USD oracles. CrossAdapters perform simple sequential queries without validation mechanisms between component oracles, creating dependency chains where the failure of either oracle causes complete price feed failure.

Each vault's solvency calculations rely entirely on the accuracy and availability of its configured external price feeds. For ERC4626 vault collaterals, the system depends on the `convertToAssets()` function of external vaults, which may be vulnerable to manipulation attacks if those vaults lack adequate protections. Pull-based oracles like Pyth introduce operational dependencies where transactions can fail if price updates are not fetched within the 2-3 minute validity window.

A permanent failure or compromise of external price feeds could result in incorrect liquidations, blocked withdrawals, or user funds being frozen in affected vaults. Observable errors in the [Oracle Dashboard](https://oracles.euler.finance/1/?page=1demonstrate) that some price feeds already experience intermittent failures, highlighting the practical risks of external oracle dependencies. The protocol's reliance on multiple external oracle providers means that vault safety depends on the continued operation and integrity of these third-party services selected by individual vault creators and risk curators.

# Governance

Euler V2 uses a multi-layered governance system with different timelock contracts and role-based access control. The system combines community discussion, off-chain voting via Snapshot, and on-chain execution through timelock contracts.

## Governance Process

### 1. Proposal Creation
Anyone can propose changes on the Euler Governance Forum. The community discusses proposals and EUL token holders vote off-chain via Snapshot for formal proposals.

### 2. Proposal Submission
The DAO multisig (4/8) at [0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe) holds the `PROPOSER_ROLE` and can submit proposals for parameter changes and role modifications.

### 3. Execution
The `EXECUTOR_ROLE` is set to address(0), meaning anyone can execute valid proposals after the timelock period expires.

## Timelock Contracts

The system is built around three TimelockController contracts:

- `TimelockController (accessControlEmergencyGovernorAdminTimelockController)`: [0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59) - Controls administrative functions with 48-hour delays
- `TimelockController (accessControlEmergencyGovernorWildcardTimelockController)`: [0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a) - Handles routine parameter changes with 48-hour delays
- `TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)`: [0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968) - Controls factory operations with 4-day delays

Malicious change could enable dangerous strategies, but requires BOTH compromised Perspective AND malicious curator to steal user funds. Honest curators provide protection even with bad Perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | DAO and EthereumVaultConnector                                                                             |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setName                    | Changes the display name of the EulerEarn vault token. This affects how the vault appears in user interfaces and block explorers. A malicious owner could set a misleading name to impersonate other vaults or confuse users about which vault they are interacting with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setSymbol                  | Changes the token symbol of the EulerEarn vault. This affects how the vault token is identified in wallets and DeFi interfaces. A malicious owner could set a confusing symbol that makes users believe they hold a different asset, potentially leading to trading errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setCurator                 | Updates the curator address who controls strategy selection and risk parameters. The curator has authority to add/remove strategies and set supply caps. A malicious owner could appoint a compromised curator who enables dangerous strategies or removes protective caps, enabling fund theft.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setIsAllocator             | Grants or revokes allocator permissions for specified addresses. Allocators control fund reallocation between strategies and queue management. A malicious owner could authorize a rogue allocator who redirects all funds to exploitable strategies or manipulates withdrawal queues to prevent user exits.                                                                                                                                                                                     | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | submitTimelock             | Initiates changes to the timelock delay required for sensitive operations. Timelock increases execute immediately while decreases require waiting the current timelock period. A malicious owner could immediately increase the timelock to maximum (30 days), delaying all guardian removals and cap changes, or reduce it to zero after timelock expires, eliminating user exit window protection.                                                                                            | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setFee                     | Adjusts the performance fee charged on positive yield up to 50%. This directly reduces user returns by redirecting yield to the fee recipient. A malicious owner could set fees to maximum 50%, permanently capturing half of all future vault earnings and significantly reducing user profitability.                                                                                                                                                                                           | DAO                                                                                |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setFeeRecipient            | Changes the address receiving all performance fees from the vault. This controls the destination of protocol revenue extracted from user yields. A malicious owner could redirect the fee recipient to their own address, stealing all accumulated and future performance fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | submitGuardian             | Proposes a new guardian address with veto powers over timelocked actions. If no guardian exists, the change is immediate; otherwise it requires timelock. A malicious owner could appoint a compromised guardian who fails to veto malicious cap increases or strategy additions, or remove the guardian entirely to eliminate the circuit-breaker protection.                                                                                                                                     | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | transferOwnership          | Initiates ownership transfer to a new address using two-step process. The new owner must accept ownership to complete the transfer. A malicious owner could transfer control to an attacker's address, granting them all owner permissions including fee manipulation, role assignment, and curator selection.                                                                                                                                                                                    | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | acceptOwnership            | Completes the two-step ownership transfer initiated by transferOwnership. This finalizes the change of vault control to the pending owner address. An attacker who compromised the pending owner address could accept ownership and gain complete control over all owner functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Pending Owner                                                                                              |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | renounceOwnership          | Permanently removes the owner, setting ownership to address(0). This makes all onlyOwner functions permanently uncallable and freezes vault configuration. If executed, the vault becomes immutable with no ability to adjust fees, change curators, or update timelocks, potentially leaving users trapped if issues arise.                                                                                                                                                                      | DAO                                                                                 |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | submitCap                  | Proposes changes to per-strategy supply caps that limit maximum allocation. Cap decreases execute immediately while increases require timelock approval. A malicious curator could immediately reduce caps to zero blocking further deposits, or submit timelocked cap increases to dangerous strategies, enabling massive fund exposure after timelock expires if guardian doesn't veto.                                                                                                        | Curator or DAO                                                                                           |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | submitMarketRemoval        | Initiates timelocked removal of a strategy vault from the withdrawal queue. Requires cap to be zero and strategy to be enabled. A malicious curator could initiate removal of legitimate high-yield strategies, forcing fund reallocation to lower-yielding or riskier alternatives, reducing overall vault returns.                                                                                                                                                                             | Curator or DAO                                                                                           |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | setSupplyQueue             | Reorders the priority queue for allocating new deposits across strategies. This determines which strategies receive funds first when users deposit. A malicious allocator could prioritize dangerous or low-yield strategies first, directing all incoming user deposits to exploitable vaults before safe alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                         | Allocator, Curator, or DAO                                                                               |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | updateWithdrawQueue        | Reorders the priority queue for sourcing funds during withdrawals and removes strategies with zero cap and no funds. This controls which strategies are tapped first when users withdraw. A malicious allocator could deprioritize liquid strategies, forcing withdrawals from illiquid or reverting strategies first, blocking user exits.                                                                                                                                                       | Allocator, Curator, or DAO                                                                               |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | reallocate                 | Moves funds between strategies by withdrawing from some and depositing to others within cap limits. This directly controls vault asset allocation across all strategies. A malicious allocator could reallocate all funds to a compromised strategy vault, concentrating risk and enabling potential fund theft through the external strategy.                                                                                                                                                    | Allocator, Curator, or DAO                                                                               |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | revokePendingTimelock      | Cancels a pending timelock change before it executes. This prevents modifications to the timelock delay that protects users. A malicious guardian could revoke legitimate timelock reductions that would improve user protection, keeping the timelock at suboptimal values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Guardian or DAO                                                                                          |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | revokePendingGuardian      | Cancels a pending guardian change before it executes. This prevents modifications to who holds veto powers over timelocked actions. A malicious guardian could revoke their own removal, maintaining control indefinitely even if they become compromised or act maliciously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Guardian or DAO                                                                                          |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | revokePendingCap           | Cancels a pending strategy cap increase before timelock expires. This prevents risky cap expansions from taking effect. A malicious curator or guardian could revoke legitimate cap increases that would improve vault capacity and user deposit limits, artificially constraining vault growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Curator, Guardian, or DAO                                                                                |
| EulerEarn (Proxy Example)     | revokePendingMarketRemoval | Cancels a pending strategy removal before timelock expires. This keeps a strategy in the withdrawal queue. A malicious curator or guardian could revoke the removal of a dangerous or compromised strategy, forcing the vault to maintain exposure to risky external vaults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Curator, Guardian, or DAO                                                                                |

This function manages three types of roles: (1) Emergency roles (LTV_EMERGENCY_ROLE, CAPS_EMERGENCY_ROLE, HOOK_EMERGENCY_ROLE) that enable immediate risk parameter reductions without delay, (2) Selector-specific roles (e.g. setCaps selector, setInterestRateModel selector) that grant permission to call specific governance functions, (3) WILD_CARD role that permits calling any function. All role assignments are subject to mandatory 48-hour timelock delay via accessControlEmergencyGovernorAdminTimelockController. A malicious DAO could grant dangerous roles to compromised addresses after 48h, enabling unauthorized parameter modifications, though the delay provides users an exit window.                                                                                                                                         | DAO                                               |

Controls the removal of emergency privileges (LTV_EMERGENCY_ROLE, CAPS_EMERGENCY_ROLE, HOOK_EMERGENCY_ROLE), selector-specific permissions, or WILD_CARD access. All role revocations are subject to mandatory 48-hour timelock delay via accessControlEmergencyGovernorAdminTimelockController. A malicious DAO could revoke legitimate roles after 48h, disabling critical risk management capabilities during market stress, though users have an exit window during the delay period.                                                                                                                                 | DAO                                                           |
