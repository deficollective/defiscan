# Summary

Euler V2 is a permissioned, decentralized lending and borrowing protocol deployed on Ethereum. It allows users to deposit assets as collateral, borrow against them, and earn interest via an on-chain interest rate model. The protocol employs smart contracts such as EVaults, a generic factory, and a router to handle asset flows, and integrates with oracles and governance modules to manage risk and updates.

# Ratings

## Chain

Euler V2 is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability



> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

Euler V2 relies on external oracle providers selected by vault creators and risk curators for all price data required for collateral valuations and liquidation decisions. Vault creators are free to choose appropriate price oracle implementations from various providers including Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, and others, thus delegating responsibility to individual actors instead of central governance.

Analysis of Euler's Oracle Dashboard reveals active usage across multiple providers, with Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv representing the primary external dependencies chosen by individual vault creators.

The protocol employs CrossAdapters that derive prices through sequential multiplication of two external oracles sharing a common asset. These create dependency chains where the failure of either component oracle causes complete price feed failure. For ERC4626 vault collaterals, the system depends on external vaults' `convertToAssets()` functions, which may be vulnerable to manipulation if those vaults lack adequate protections.

Pull-based oracles like Pyth introduce operational dependencies where transactions can fail if price updates are not fetched within the 2-3 minute validity window. Observable errors in the Oracle Dashboard demonstrate that some price feeds already experience intermittent failures, highlighting the practical risks of external oracle dependencies.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Euler V2 implements timelock mechanisms for some governance functions but lacks comprehensive exit window protection for critical operations. While the protocol uses TimelockController contracts with 48-hour and 4-day delays for certain administrative functions, many critical permissions can be executed immediately without any delay.

The most critical function that bypasses exit windows entirely is the `setImplementation` function of the `GenericFactory` contract which can immediately upgrade the implementation for all upgradeable vaults (those deployed as beacon proxies) across the protocol. However, this only affects vaults that were created with the upgradeable flag set to true, not immutable vaults (minimal proxies).

Additionally, numerous other functions can be executed immediately without delay, including the `pause` function of the `FactoryGovernor` contract which can freeze all vault operations instantly, vault parameter functions like the `setLTV`, `setInterestRateModel` functions of the `EVault` contract that can be modified without delay by vault governors, and protocol-wide configuration functions like the `setProtocolFeeShare` function of the `ProtocolConfig` contract which can redirect all yield to attackers and oracle configuration functions like the `govSetConfig` function of the `EulerRouter` contract which can switch to compromised oracles from the approved registry.

The limited timelock protections (48-hour and 4-day delays) apply only to a subset of administrative functions and fall well below the 7-day minimum threshold required for medium risk classification.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Users can only access Euler V2 through a single user interface: app.euler.finance. Currently, there is no backup solution in case the interface is shut down or users are censored.

# Reviewer's Notes








# Protocol Analysis

## Core Architecture

Euler V2 utilizes a modular vault-based lending system built around the [EthereumVaultConnector (EVC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C9a3dd6b8F28529d72d7f9cE918D493519EE383) and the [GenericFactory (EVault Proxy)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29a56a1b8214D9Cf7c5561811750D5cBDb45CC8e). The protocol enables permissionless creation of isolated lending markets where each vault functions as an ERC-4626 compliant tokenized debt market for a specific underlying asset.

The EVC serves as the foundational multicall contract that mediates all cross-vault operations, enabling atomic batching, sub-account management, and sophisticated position isolation. Individual EVaults are deployed through the factory system using the [EVault (Implementation)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8Ff1C814719096b61aBf00Bb46EAd0c9A529Dd7D) as the implementation contract, maintaining full ERC-4626 compatibility for seamless integration with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## Vault Creation and Management

### Vault Deployment Process

Vaults are created through the [GenericFactory (EVault Proxy)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29a56a1b8214D9Cf7c5561811750D5cBDb45CC8e) contract, which deploys proxy instances pointing to the standardized [EVault (Implementation)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8Ff1C814719096b61aBf00Bb46EAd0c9A529Dd7D). The factory supports two deployment modes:

Upgradeable Vaults: Deployed as beacon proxies, allowing the [FactoryGovernor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2F13256E04022d6356d8CE8C53C7364e13DC1f3d) to upgrade implementations in case of critical bugs
Immutable Vaults: Deployed as minimal proxies, providing complete immutability once deployed

Each vault is configured with specific parameters including underlying asset, oracle router, interest rate model, and governance settings. The factory ensures all vaults are initialized securely and can be verified as originating from a trusted source.

### Governance and Control

Vault governance operates through a modular system where each vault can be assigned a governor address. The protocol supports multiple governance patterns:

- [GovernorAccessControlEmergency](https://etherscan.io/address/0x35400831044167E9E2DE613d26515eeE37e30a1b): Selector-based access control with emergency roles for rapid response
- [CapRiskSteward](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFE56cAa36DA676364e1a0a97e4f7C07651e89B95): Specialized risk management for delegated parameter adjustments
- Timelock Integration: Three TimelockController contracts provide time-delayed execution:
  - [accessControlEmergencyGovernorAdminTimelockController](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59) - 48-hour delays
  - [accessControlEmergencyGovernorWildcardTimelockController](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a) - 48-hour delays  
  - [eVaultFactoryTimelockController](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968) - 4-day delays

## Lending and Borrowing Mechanics

### Deposit and Withdrawal Process

Users deposit underlying assets into vaults through the standard ERC-4626 interface, receiving vault shares representing proportional ownership. The vault tracks internal balances rather than reading from the underlying asset contract, preventing manipulation through direct transfers and supporting rebasing tokens.

The exchange rate grows deterministically as interest accrues:
exchangeRate = (cash + totalBorrows + VIRTUAL_DEPOSIT) / (totalShares + VIRTUAL_DEPOSIT)

The VIRTUAL_DEPOSIT mechanism prevents manipulation through rounding-based "stealth deposits" and ensures the exchange rate is well-defined even with zero shares.

### Borrowing and Collateralization

Borrowing requires users to enable specific vaults as collateral and controller through the EVC. The system supports cross-vault collateralization, where assets deposited in one vault can serve as collateral for borrowing from another vault.

Each collateral vault is configured with separate Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios through the `setLTV` function:
- `Borrow LTV`: Maximum ratio for new borrowing
- `Liquidation LTV`: Threshold for liquidation eligibility
- `Spread LTV`: Buffer between borrow and liquidation thresholds

The EVC defers solvency and cap checks until the end of a batch, enabling complex multi-step workflows while maintaining system integrity.

### Interest Rate Models

Euler V2 supports multiple interest rate model types through specialized factories:

`Kink IRM Factory` at [0xcAe0A39B45Ee9C3213f64392FA6DF30CE034C9F9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAe0A39B45Ee9C3213f64392FA6DF30CE034C9F9): Deploys linear kink interest rate models with piecewise-linear curves and "kink" points.

`Adaptive Curve IRM Factory` at [0x3EC2d5af936bBB57DD19C292BAfb89da0E377F42](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3EC2d5af936bBB57DD19C292BAfb89da0E377F42): Deploys adaptive curve models that dynamically adjust rates based on market conditions.

`Fixed Cyclical Binary IRM Factory` at [0xa8F8E82C9Da15A991D7BF2486aE26e22743aC8d0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8F8E82C9Da15A991D7BF2486aE26e22743aC8d0): Deploys fixed-rate cyclical binary models.

Interest is compounded deterministically every second using exponentiation, with rates expressed in "second percent yield" (SPY) values scaled by 1e27.

## Sub-Account System

### Account Structure

The EVC provides each user address with 256 virtual sub-accounts, enabling sophisticated position isolation and risk management. Sub-account addresses are derived by XOR-ing the main address with a number from 0 to 255:

```solidity
function getAccount(address owner, uint8 accountId) public pure returns (address) {
    return address(uint160(owner) ^ uint160(accountId));
}
```

All 256 sub-accounts share the first 19 bytes of their address, making them easily identifiable as belonging to the same owner.

### Position Isolation

Sub-accounts enable users to:
- Manage multiple isolated positions with different risk parameters
- Separate strategies and collateral types
- Implement sophisticated risk management across positions
- Maintain convenience of using a single wallet

Each sub-account can independently enable/disable collateral and controller vaults, borrow from different vaults, and maintain separate debt positions.

## Liquidation System

### Reverse Dutch Auction Mechanism

Euler V2 implements a reverse dutch auction system for liquidations, where the discount scales proportionally with how deeply in violation a position becomes. The `setMaxLiquidationDiscount` function controls the maximum discount parameter, preventing harmful liquidation spirals.

### Collateral Control

When a position becomes undercollateralized, the controller vault can invoke `controlCollateral` through the EVC to seize collateral from the borrower's enabled collateral vaults. This function allows the controller to withdraw assets on behalf of the violating account, typically to repay outstanding debt.

The liquidation process is atomic and secure, with only the controller vault able to initiate it for accounts that have enabled it as a controller.

## EulerSwap Integration

### Capital-Efficient AMM Design

EulerSwap is implemented through three core contracts:
- `EulerSwapFactory` at [EulerSwapFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb013be1D0D380C13B58e889f412895970A2Cf228)
- `EulerSwap Implementation` at [0xc35a0FDA69e9D71e68C0d9CBb541Adfd21D6B117](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc35a0FDA69e9D71e68C0d9CBb541Adfd21D6B117)
- `EulerSwapPeriphery` at [0x208fF5Eb543814789321DaA1B5Eb551881D16b06](https://etherscan.io/address/0x208fF5Eb543814789321DaA1B5Eb551881D16b06)

Unlike traditional AMMs, liquidity remains in the user's Euler account, continuing to earn lending interest and protocol rewards.

### Swap Execution

The swap system operates through two periphery contracts:
- `Swapper` at [0x2Bba09866b6F1025258542478C39720A09B728bF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2Bba09866b6F1025258542478C39720A09B728bF): Executes swaps using external DEXs
- `SwapVerifier` at [0xae26485ACDDeFd486Fe9ad7C2b34169d360737c7](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae26485ACDDeFd486Fe9ad7C2b34169d360737c7): Verifies swap outcomes and enforces slippage limits

## Oracle System

### Modular Oracle Architecture

Euler V2 supports a wide range of oracle providers through the `EulerRouterFactory` at [0x70B3f6F61b7Bf237DF04589DdAA842121072326A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70B3f6F61b7Bf237DF04589DdAA842121072326A) and `EulerRouter` at [0x8ab93f4ee16fb9c0086651a85f941b8a8716cd57](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ab93f4ee16fb9c0086651a85f941b8a8716cd57). The system operates through a modular architecture combining immutable Adapters and configurable Routers.

Analysis of Euler's Oracle Adapters Addresses reveals active usage across 12 distinct provider types including Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv.

### Oracle Registry

The `SnapshotRegistry (oracleAdapterRegistry)` at [0xA084A7F49723E3cc5722E052CF7fce910E7C5Fe6](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA084A7F49723E3cc5722E052CF7fce910E7C5Fe6) maintains a registry of approved oracle adapters, ensuring only verified price feeds are used by vaults.

## Reward and Incentive System

### Protocol Rewards

Euler V2 implements a comprehensive reward system through:
- `EUL Token` at [0xd9Fcd98c322942075A5C3860693e9f4f03AAE07b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd9Fcd98c322942075A5C3860693e9f4f03AAE07b): Protocol governance token
- `RewardToken (rEUL)` at [0xf3e621395fc714B90dA337AA9108771597b4E696](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3e621395fc714B90dA337AA9108771597b4E696): Reward token representing earned EUL
- `TrackingRewardStreams` at [0x0D52d06ceB8Dcdeeb40Cfd9f17489B350dD7F8a3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D52d06ceB8Dcdeeb40Cfd9f17489B350dD7F8a3): Manages reward distribution

### Balance Forwarding

The balance forwarding system enables instant and trustless distribution of rewards while keeping gas costs low. When an account opts in, every balance change triggers a notification to the TrackingRewardStreams contract.

## EulerEarn System

### Yield Aggregation

EulerEarn provides yield aggregation through:
- `EulerEarnFactory` at [0x9a20d3C0c283646e9701a049a2f8C152Bc1e3427](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a20d3C0c283646e9701a049a2f8C152Bc1e3427)
- `EulerEarnFactory2` at [0x59709B029B140C853FE28d277f83C3a65e308aF4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x59709B029B140C853FE28d277f83C3a65e308aF4)
- `EulerEarn Implementation` at [0xBa42141648dFD74388f3541C1d80fa9387043Da9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa42141648dFD74388f3541C1d80fa9387043Da9)

The system aggregates user deposits into curated sets of underlying lending vaults, optimizing yield while preserving risk isolation per strategy.

## Security Features

### Emergency Response

The EVC provides two emergency modes for user protection:
- `Lockdown Mode`: Restricts all operations except operator management and nonce updates
- `Permit Disabled Mode`: Prevents execution of any permits signed by the owner

### Access Control

The protocol implements sophisticated access control through:
- `Operator Delegation`: Users can delegate control of sub-accounts to trusted contracts
- `Role-Based Governance`: Granular permissions for different governance functions
- `Timelock Protection`: Time-delayed execution for sensitive operations

### Upgradeability and Immutability

Vault creators can choose between:
- `Upgradeable Vaults`: Can be upgraded by `FactoryGovernor` for critical bug fixes
- `Immutable Vaults`: Completely immutable once deployed

The `FactoryGovernor` is controlled by the `eVaultFactoryTimelockController` and can only upgrade vault implementations, not individual vault configurations.

## Integration and Composability

### EVC Batching

The EVC enables atomic batching of operations across multiple vaults and external contracts. This allows complex strategies like:
- Opening leveraged positions in a single transaction
- Rebalancing collateral across multiple vaults
- Executing flash loans with automatic repayment
- Combining lending, borrowing, and swapping operations

### ERC-4626 Compatibility

All vaults implement the ERC-4626 standard, ensuring seamless integration with:
- DeFi aggregators and yield farming protocols
- Portfolio management tools
- Tax accounting software
- Standard DeFi interfaces

### Lens Contracts

The protocol provides comprehensive data access through specialized lens contracts:
- `AccountLens` at [0x94B9D29721f0477402162C93d95B3b4e52425844](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94B9D29721f0477402162C93d95B3b4e52425844)
- `VaultLens` at [0xB65C7ac387A45d7b4709166784BB431A58Bc59eB](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65C7ac387A45d7b4709166784BB431A58Bc59eB)
- `OracleLens` at [0x0C47736aaBEE757AB8C8F60776741e39DBf3F183](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C47736aaBEE757AB8C8F60776741e39DBf3F183)
- `UtilsLens` at [0xB8cac3e5CaaC2042B79938aFe7FEA3f44e5afcC1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB8cac3e5CaaC2042B79938aFe7FEA3f44e5afcC1)

This modular, composable architecture makes Euler V2 a foundational layer for sophisticated DeFi strategies while maintaining security and user control over their positions.








# Dependencies

## Oracles

Euler V2 employs a vendor-agnostic oracle system supporting multiple price feed providers selected by vault creators and risk curators. The system operates through a modular architecture combining immutable Adapters that interface with external oracles and convert data to standardized ERC-7726 format, and configurable Routers that dispatch price queries.

The protocol distinguishes between push-based oracles like Chainlink that automatically update prices at regular intervals, and pull-based oracles like Pyth that require manual price updates with 2-3 minute validity periods. Analysis of Euler's Oracle Dashboard reveals active usage across multiple providers, with Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, Chronicle, Lido, Pendle, Midas, MEV Capital, Idle, and Resolv representing the primary external dependencies chosen by individual vault creators.

The system also employs CrossAdapters that derive prices through sequential multiplication of two oracles sharing a common asset. For example, wstETH/USD pricing is derived by chaining wstETH/stETH and stETH/USD oracles. CrossAdapters perform simple sequential queries without validation mechanisms between component oracles, creating dependency chains where the failure of either oracle causes complete price feed failure.

Each vault's solvency calculations rely entirely on the accuracy and availability of its configured external price feeds. For ERC4626 vault collaterals, the system depends on the `convertToAssets()` function of external vaults, which may be vulnerable to manipulation attacks if those vaults lack adequate protections. Pull-based oracles like Pyth introduce operational dependencies where transactions can fail if price updates are not fetched within the 2-3 minute validity window.

A permanent failure or compromise of external price feeds could result in incorrect liquidations, blocked withdrawals, or user funds being frozen in affected vaults. Observable errors in the [Oracle Dashboard](https://oracles.euler.finance/1/?page=1demonstrate) that some price feeds already experience intermittent failures, highlighting the practical risks of external oracle dependencies. The protocol's reliance on multiple external oracle providers means that vault safety depends on the continued operation and integrity of these third-party services selected by individual vault creators and risk curators.

# Governance

Euler V2 uses a multi-layered governance system with different timelock contracts and role-based access control. The system combines community discussion, off-chain voting via Snapshot, and on-chain execution through timelock contracts.

## Governance Process

### 1. Proposal Creation
Anyone can propose changes on the Euler Governance Forum. The community discusses proposals and EUL token holders vote off-chain via Snapshot for formal proposals.

### 2. Proposal Submission
The DAO multisig (4/8) at [0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe) holds the `PROPOSER_ROLE` and can submit proposals for parameter changes and role modifications.

### 3. Execution
The `EXECUTOR_ROLE` is set to address(0), meaning anyone can execute valid proposals after the timelock period expires.

## Timelock Contracts

The system is built around three TimelockController contracts:

- `TimelockController (accessControlEmergencyGovernorAdminTimelockController)`: [0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBfeE2D937FB9223FFD65b7cDF607bd1DA9B97E59) - Controls administrative functions with 48-hour delays
- `TimelockController (accessControlEmergencyGovernorWildcardTimelockController)`: [0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b8C367aE56656b1D0901b2ADd1AD3226fF74f5a) - Handles routine parameter changes with 48-hour delays
- `TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)`: [0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb034c1C6c7F42171b2d1Cb8486E0f43ED07A968) - Controls factory operations with 4-day delays

A malicious TimelockController3 could grant itself all roles or assign them to compromised addresses, completely undermining the factory governance system.                                                                                                                                                    | TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController) (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)(eVaultFactoryTimelockController) |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | revokeRole                 | Modifies the _roles mapping to remove a specific role from a given address. Controls the revocation of access permissions to critical factory timelock functions. A malicious TimelockController3 could revoke roles from legitimate addresses, permanently blocking factory governance processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                | TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController) (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)(eVaultFactoryTimelockController) |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | schedule                   | Modifies the _timestamps mapping to register an operation with a minimum 4-day execution delay. Determines which factory operations can be queued for future execution with extended timelock protection. A malicious proposer could schedule dangerous factory operations like implementation upgrades or parameter changes affecting all vaults.                                                                                                                                                | DAO (PROPOSER_ROLE)                                                                                        |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | scheduleBatch              | Modifies the _timestamps mapping to register multiple simultaneous operations with a minimum 4-day execution delay. Enables coordination of complex factory changes requiring multiple atomic transactions with extended protection. A malicious proposer could schedule coordinated factory operation batches to compromise the entire vault ecosystem simultaneously.                                                                                                                           | DAO (PROPOSER_ROLE)                                                                                        |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | cancel                     | Modifies the _timestamps mapping by deleting the entry corresponding to the targeted operation ID. Allows cancellation of scheduled factory operations before execution to prevent dangerous changes. A malicious canceller could cancel legitimate critical factory operations like security fixes or urgent implementation updates.                                                                                                                                                             | DAO or Security Council (CANCELLER_ROLE)                                                                   |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | execute                    | Modifies the _timestamps mapping by marking the operation as executed and performs the call to the target contract. Executes only operations previously scheduled by authorized proposers after the mandatory 4-day delay has elapsed. Anyone can trigger execution of valid operations, but only operations pre-approved by the DAO can be executed, providing transparent and predictable governance execution.                                                                                 | Open to all (address(0))                                                                                   |
| TimelockController (eVaultFactoryTimelockController)                          | executeBatch               | Modifies the _timestamps mapping by marking the batch operation as executed and performs all calls to target contracts. Executes only operation batches previously scheduled by authorized proposers after the mandatory 4-day delay. Anyone can trigger batch execution, but only batches pre-approved by the DAO can be executed, ensuring coordinated governance changes remain under DAO control.                                                                                             | Open to all (address(0))                                                                                   |
