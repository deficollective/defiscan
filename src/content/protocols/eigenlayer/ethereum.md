# Summary

Eigenlayer is a marketplace that matches compute (by _Operators_) with tasks (by _AVSs_). In order that _AVSs_ trust the _Operators_, the _Operators_ need economic security (stake), which is provided by _(Re)Stakers_, that can be slashed in case of shortcoming of operational performance. _(Re)Stakers_ have to trust _Operators_ that they do their tasks according to the requirements stated by the _AVSs_. For economic stake, _(Re)Stakers_ can use arbitrary ERC20 tokens, which also includes LSTs, or Beacon Chain deposits to increase capital efficiency of staked ETH.

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Eigenlayer protocol deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet achieves a _Low_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

Contracts which control user funds, the accounting of delegation and slashing are fully _upgradeable_ and this can lead to _loss of user funds_ and _loss of unclaimed yield_.

Single strategy contracts that hold the _Staker's_ funds can be paused immediately by pausers registered in the `PauserRegistry` contract. Pausing can lead to temporary loss of access to funds, the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) however can resume the pause immediately if misused.

Rewards committed by _AVSs_ to the `RewardsCoordinator` contract are distributed to _Operators_ and _Stakers_ via a merkle tree root posted by the `RewardsUpdater` role owner, which computes eligibility for each restaker and operator based on their stake and AVS rewards specification. If the account that holds the `RewardsUpdater` role is compromised, the rewards can be distributed to the wrong accounts, which leads to _loss of unclaimed yield_.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

The Eigenlayer protocol does not rely on a single _Operator_, nor on a single _AVS_ to work since it is a market place that brings _AVSs_ and _Operators_ together. Thus the overall _Dependency_ risk is _low_. However, single _AVSs_ or _Operators_ can impose risks to each other as the respective counterparties.

The [Dependencies](#dependencies) section goes into more detail about risks potentially originating from _AVSs_ and _Operators_.

> Autonomy score: Low

## Exit Window

### Upgrading contracts

The upgrading of all smart contracts can be executed through the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) which has two signers, the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) and the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council). The [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) has a sufficient _Exit Window_ of 10 days or the upgrade can also be executed immediately through the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer which adheres to the [Security Council Requirements](/learn-more#security-council-requirements).

For the `bEIGEN` token there is a dedicated parallel upgrade process, which is also controlled by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer and a dedicated [bEIGEN TimelockController](#security-council) with a sufficient _Exit Window_ of 24 days.

### Pausing Strategy Contracts

Single strategies can be paused immediately by pausers registered in the `PauserRegistry` contract which includes the [Pauser Multisig (1/2)](#security-council), the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) and the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council). During a pause, the _(Re)Stakers_ cannot withdraw their funds, after their withdrawal queue period is over. Resuming (Unpausing) can only be enforced by the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) with a 10 day _Exit Window_ or immediately through the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer which adheres to the [Security Council Requirements](/learn-more#security-council-requirements).

Immediate upgrade of contracts can only be executed by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer, thus the _Exit Window_ score is _High_. However, the impact on the total score is _Medium_ (_Stage 1_), as the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) satisfies the [Security Council Requirements](/learn-more#security-council-requirements). Multisigs that are not compliant with the [Security Council Requirements](/learn-more#security-council-requirements) can initiate upgrades as well, but are protected by an _Exit Window_ of more than 7 days and can be overruled by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council).

## Rewards

The `RewardsUpdater` can immediately remove a root and post a new root, claiming all deposited funds by AVSs instead of distributing them to _Operators_ and _Stakers_. Immediate*loss of unclaimed yield* leads to _Medium_ _Exit Window_ score.

The worst _Exit Window_ score of the different vectors is _High_.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

There are no other frontends available for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ to delegate and initiate withdrawal. The Eigenlayer protocol does not provide a frontend for _AVSs_ to manage their contracts as they can be very different.

For _Operators_ a CLI is available to interact with the Eigenlayer protocol, for configuration allocations, registering to _Operator Sets_ and to configure rewards. We argue that the option of a CLI is like self hosting (_Medium_), because it's local, but not low risk, because if the CLI has a bug/vulnerability, as there is no diversity in terms of execution of the _Operator_ actions.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The Eigenlayer protocol achieves _High_ centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Exit Window_ and _Accessibility_ dimensions. It achieves _Low_ centralization risk scores for its _Autonomy_ dimension. Eigenlayer overall ranks _Stage 0_. The impact of the _Upgradeability_ and _Exit Window_ on the overall score is _Medium_ (_Stage 1_), because the permission owners satisfy the _Security Council Requirements_.

The protocol could reach _Stage 1_ by offering a self-hosting option for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ to manage their delegation and withdrawal.

The project additionally could advance to _Stage 2_ if alternative frontends are available for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ to manage their delegation and withdrawal and the _Upgradeability_ is protected by 30 days _Exit Window_.

# Reviewer's Notes

- _Stakers_ denote users that deposit general ERC20 tokens in Eigenlayer to secure AVSs. _Restakers_ denote users that deposit beacon chain deposits or `LSTs` in Eigenlayer to secure AVSs.
- _AVSs_ are required to deploy their own smart contracts which interact with the Eigenlayer smart contracts. These smart contracts are not part of the Eigenlayer protocol and thus are not part of this review.

# Protocol Analysis

![Eigenlayer](../diagrams/eigenlayer-overview.png)

Open Tasks:

- add permissioned pause functions for all contracts that inherit `Pausable`
- Scan EigenPod
- clean up overview diagram, create diagrams for depositing, delegating, slashing, withdrawing

Open questions:

- if Signer of multisig is internal, does it count as publicly announced?
- what's the wind down phase for a staker to change operators, in consideration that the operator redirects future rewards 100% to itself.

## Roles

### Stakers and Restakers

A _Staker_ or _Restaker_ is any user who has assets deposited (or "restaked") into EigenLayer. They can stake or restake multiple assets that are accepted as _Economic Security_ to secure _AVSs_.

The _Staker_ or _Restaker_ has the following actions available; 1) deposit assets into EigenLayer via either the `StrategyManager` (for ERC20s) or the `EigenPodManager` (for beacon chain ETH), 2) withdraw assets via the `DelegationManager`, no matter what assets they're withdrawing, 3) and delegate to an _Operator_ via the `DelegationManager`.

### Operators

_Operators_ are entities that opt-in to _Operator Sets_ created by _AVSs_ to execute tasks for the _AVS_. _Operators_ receive economic stake delegated by the _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ and take a cut from the weekly rewards issued by the _AVSs_ (default: 10% _Operator_, 90% _Stakers_ and _Restakers_). _Operators_ can also stake themselves, the roles are not mutually exclusive.

### AVSs

_AVSs_ are entities that offer services to their own end users (e.g. Cryptographic Services, Data Availability, Bridging, Oracles, etc.). These services require task execution by a economically secured and distributed set of nodes, such as a PoS system. This task is required to be objective and verifiable such that _Operators_ from the Eigenlayer marketplace opt-in to execute this task such that the _AVS_ can offer its service. Eigenlayer helps thus to make Beacon-Chain deposits more economically efficient by allowing _ETH Stakers_ to restake this economic stake to secure also other services, such as _AVSs_. Additionally, _Stakers_ can also use arbitrary ERC20 tokens, which also includes LSTs.

_AVSs_ are required to deploy their own smart contracts which interact with the Eigenlayer smart contracts. The details of the implementation are free to choose by the _AVS_, but they to implement the following functions:

- slash operators (calling `slashOperator` on the `AllocationManager` contract)
- create operator sets (calling `createOperatorSets` or `createRedistributingOperatorSet` on the `AllocationManager` contract)
- supply and register rewards for _Operators_ and _Stakers_ (calling `createOperatorDirectedOperatorSetRewardsSubmission` on the `RewardsCoordinator` contract)
- to allow registered operators to post results

among other functions to update and configure operator sets.

Additionally, _AVSs_ can increase fairness and transparency guarantees by; 1) allowing the Operators to veto a slash, 2) create protocols to eject _Operators_, 3) to create quorums for submission or veto and 4) to compute rewards on-chain instead of off-chain.

Regarding rewards, _AVSs_ are free to design their own reward logic, whether it is based on offchain or onchain data, and can distribute rewards in any ERC20 token. For instance, an _AVS_ can distribute a flat rate of rewards or a performance-based reward structure that is dependent on the work performed by _Operators_ within a certain time period. Additionally, an AVS can submit multiple reward submissions, denominated in different tokens, to offer more flexibility in the distribution of rewards.

## Important Eigenlayer Contracts and Concepts

### Strategies

Each asset that is accepted as _Economic Security_ to secure _AVSs_ is held in a separate contract. These contracts are also called Strategy contracts.

The EigenLayer protocol deploys different types of strategy contracts. The three types of strategy contracts are:

1. **Beacon Chain Deposit Strategy**: This strategy contract is directly connected to the beacon chain and is responsible for managing the deposit/withdrawal of beacon chain deposits. The strategy contract is called `EigenPod` and each _Restaker_ has its own `EigenPod` contract, which validates a proof that the withdrawal credentials point to this contract, such that the Eigenlayer protocol can use the funds to slash operators.
2. **Legacy Strategy Contracts**: These are a set of transparent upgradeable proxy contracts that each hold liquid staking ETH tokens. Each contract needs to be upgraded separately by the `ProxyAdmin` contract.
3. **Factory based Strategy Contracts**: These are contracts that are instantiated through the `StrategyFactory` and are responsible for managing tokens added by users themselves. These contracts are upgradeable and share the same implementation contract (beacon proxy), which allows to update the contracts all at once.

Each strategy contract is upgradeable, and since the funds are held in the strategy contract, an upgrade could lead to _loss of funds_ if compromised.

The `StrategyFactory` creates new strategies (ie allows to accept new ERC20 tokens as security), with the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) controlling strategy whitelisting and blacklisting, which corresponds to whitelisting/blacklisting ERC20 tokens as _Economic Security_ for _AVSs_. When a _Strategy_ is removed from the whitelist or blacklisted, _Stakers_ can still withdraw or delegate existing funds, but new deposits are blocked. By default, new strategies created by the factory are whitelisted.

### EigenPods

Each `EigenPod` shares the same implementation contract, which allows to update the `EigenPods` contracts all at once by the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) with the Beacon-Proxy `UpgradeableBeacon` contract. A malicious upgrade could be used to withdraw the ETH from the Beacon-Chain by using the EIP-7002 execution layer triggereable withdrawals, by adding a function that allows to withdraw the ETH from the Beacon-Chain to a malicious address. However, updates like this can be cancelled by the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council).

Under normal operations, a proof of the withdrawal credentials pointing to the `EigenPod` address supplied by the _Restaker_ and Owner of the `EigenPod` is required to create deposit shares in the `EigenPodManager` contract, which then can be used to delegate to _Operators_ and earn additional rewards from the _AVSs_.

If a _Restaker_ wants to withdraw their funds from the Beacon Chain, they need to start a checkpoint and verify the checkpoint to update their shares in the `EigenPodManager` based on Rewards they received on the Beacon Chain. The checkpoint specifies the delta to be registered and the old Beacon Chain balance. This additional shares can be withdrawn or used to delegate to _Operators_. Reduced Beacon Chain deposits through slashing, lead to a reduction of the shares. To withdraw ETH from the Beacon Chain, _Restakers_ can use the EIP-7002 execution layer triggereable withdrawals, via calling `queueWithdrawal` on the `EigenPod` contract, or use the Consensus Layer primary key to initiate the withdrawal to the Execution Layer. To be able to withdraw the ETH deposited in the `EigenPod` contract through the previous step, _Restakers_ need to initiate the transfer via the `DelegationManager` by calling `queueWithdrawawal`, after the cooldown period is over, _Restakers_ need to call `completeQueuedWithdrawal` on the `DelegationManager` contract, which allows to send the ETH to the _Restaker_. During this two step process, sufferred slashes by _AVS_ are taken into account to calculate the final amount of ETH to be sent to the _Restaker_.

### DelegationManager

The `DelegationManager` is the contract that allows _Stakers_ to delegate their stake to _Operators_. The contract also allows users to register as _Operators_ in the Eigenlayer system, which is a requirement for _Operators_ to register in _Operator Sets_ created by _AVSs_.

The `DelegationManager` calls `addShares` and `removeDepositShares` on the `StrategyManager` contract to update delegated shares and link them to deposits. These functions are essential for maintaining accurate accounting of staked assets. Also, the `DelegationManager` keeps the accounting of the suffered slashes.

Furthermore, _Operators_ can configure a _Delegation Approver_, that requires _Stakers_ to first get an approval before they may delegate to the _Operator_ through the `DelegationManager` contract. This way, _Operators_ can prevent _Stakers_ from delegating their funds to them and keep a privileged set of _Stakers_. If the _Delegation Approver_ is set to the 0-address, any _Staker_ can delegate their stake to the respective _Operator_.

The contract's _Upgradeability_ through the `ProxyAdmin` contract introduces an _Upgradeability_ risk, as the upgrade could potentially modify core delegation logic, the slashing accounting and thus lead to _loss of funds_ of _Stakers_ if the upgrade is malicious or faulty, as _(Re)Stakers_ initiate withdrawals of funds through this contract.

### AllocationManager

The `AllocationManager` contract allows _AVSs_ to slash _Operators_ that do not comply with their terms on correct operation of the instructions by the _AVSs_. The `AllocationManager` contract forwards the slashing request by the _AVSs_ to the `DelegationManager` contract, which keeps the accounting of the suffered slashes and updates the claim for each _Staker_.

Through the `AllocationManager` the `AVSs` can manage operator sets (creation and changes) and AVS configurations. The `AllocationManager` allows _Operators_ to register and deregister from _Operator Sets_ and _AVSs_.

The _AVSs_ can setup an `AVSRegistrar` contract, which is called by the `AllocationManager` when _Operators_ register to and deregister from _operator sets_. If the _AVS_ does not have an `AVSRegistrar` set, the `AllocationManager` will forward the call to the registered _AVS_ contract. If the `AVSRegistrar` or the registered _AVS_ contract reverts the transaction, the `AllocationManager` will revert the transaction as well, and _Operators_ will not be able to register to or deregister from operator sets. This can create unfair scenarios, where _AVSs_ allow opt-in, but disallow opt-out.

### RewardsCoordinator

The `RewardsCoordinator` contract holds funds sent by the AVSs which will be distributed to _Operators_ and _Stakers_ as rewards. By default, _Operators_ receive 10% and _Stakers_ 90% of the rewards distributed by the _AVSs_. The _Operators_ can change the reward split by calling `setOperatorAVSSplit`.

The `RewardsUpdater` calculates rewards offchain and consolidates these into a merkle root posted onchain by calling the `submitRoot` function. The `disableRoot` function can be called by the `RewardsUpdater` to disable the current root and prevent further distributions. If the `disableRoot` function is called, _Operators_ and _Stakers_ cannot further claim their rewards and rely on the Eigenlayer protocol to re-enable the reward distribution mechanism, by posting a new root.

This means the `RewardsUpdater` role must be completely trusted in the distribution of rewards. Malicious behavior by the Eigenlayer protocol could lead to _loss of unclaimed yield_. The [Operator Multisig](#security-council) can appoint a new `RewardsUpdater` in case of compromised or malicious behavior.

Rewards are distributed periodically, with a delay period of 7 days before new splits are applied.

The _Upgradeability_ of the `RewardsCoordinator`, controlled by the `ProxyAdmin`, means that the economic parameters governing reward distribution could be modified. This includes the 90/10 default split between _Stakers_ and _Operators_.

### PermissionController

The `PermissionController` is a contract that allows AVS and Operators to appoint general admins or appointees (can call only selected addresses and functions).

The _Upgradeability_ of the `PermissionController`, controlled by the `ProxyAdmin`, means that permissions to slash operators on behalf of AVS (as an appointee) can be hijacked by a permission owner going rogue, leading to _loss of funds_ for _Stakers_ and loss of delegated stake for _Operators_.

### PauserRegistry

The `PauserRegistry` contract informs all pausable contracts, who can pause, and who can unpause.

### EIGEN and bEIGEN

The BackingEigen (`bEIGEN`) token contract is upgradeable, which means that the permissions to upgrade the token contract can have an impact on user funds, such as dilution or change of ownership. New minters of `bEIGEN` can be appointed with the `setIsMinter` function, which could lead to malicious minters mis-using this minting right to wrap it into EIGEN tokens.

### Programmatic Incentives

Programmatic Incentives (PI) are distributed in `EIGEN` tokens minted by the Eigenlayer protocol and offered to _Stakers_ and _Operators_ through the `RewardsController` contract.

# Dependencies

The Eigenlayer protocol does not depend on single _AVSs_ or _Operators_. However, _AVSs_, _Stakers_ and _Operators_ depend on each other, and it is recommended to be well diversified with their counterparties to mitigate dependency risks.

The following subsections highlight risks potentially coming from _AVSs_ and _Operators_.

## Slashing Operators

During normal operation, when slashing is not paused, the _AVSs_ can slash _Operators_ by specifying which _Strategies_ should be slashed and by which amount. This leads to _loss of funds_ for _Stakers_ and loss of delegated stake for _Operators_. The slashing can be fair (according to published terms by the _AVSs_) or unfair (not according to published terms by the _AVSs_). Slashing can be paused by pausers registered in the `PauserRegistry` contract.

## Deregistering Operators from Operator Sets

Deregistration of _Operators_ from _Operator Sets_ can be prevented by _AVSs_ by reverting `deregisterOperator` on the registered `AVSRegistrar` contract, a contract specific to each _AVS_ that is controlled by each _AVSs_. This could open a greater time window for an _AVS_ to slash _Operators_, leading to _loss of funds_ for _(Re)Stakers_ and loss of delegated stake for _Operators_.

## Slacking Operators

_Operators_ could technically provoke slashing and _loss of funds_ for restakers, but it is not in their interest to do so, as it would damage their reputation.

# Governance

The [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) holds all upgrade permissions of the protocol through the `ProxyAdmin` contract or directly on the contracts themselves. The [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council)'s signers are the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) and the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council).

The [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) has two admins, the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) and the contract itself. Additionally three roles exist; proposer, canceler and executor. The proposers are the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) and the [Protocol Council (3/5)](#security-council), the canceler is the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) and the executor is the [Protocol Council (3/5)](#security-council).

| DelegationManager (Proxy)                | changeAdmin                                        | The admin can upgrade the `DelegationManager` contract. The `DelegationManager` contract manages delegations from restakers to operators. Restakers that want to withdraw from active (delegated) positions, need to call this contract to withdraw their funds. If this contract is maliciously upgraded it could block withdrawal of user funds or change claimable funds and yield and thus it could lead to a loss of user funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| DelegationManager (Implementation)       | modifyOperatorDetails                              | Allows an operator to change the `delegation approver` for the respective operator. If the delegation approver is set to the 0-address, any staker can delegate their stake to the respective operator. If a delegation approver is configured all new stakers need to get a signature from the approver first, before they can delegate to this operator. Funds of existing stakers are not blocked when the operator transitions to a delegation approver setting, but the approver can forcefully return the stake to the staker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | only registered Operators                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Changing the admin transfers the right to upgrade the contract.

An upgrade can lead to maliciously allowing addresses to act on behalf of operators and AVSs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                |
