# Summary

Eigenlayer is a marketplace that matches compute (by _Operators_) with tasks (by _AVSs_). In order that _AVSs_ trust the _Operators_ with the given tasks, the _Operators_ need economic security (stake), which is provided by _(Re)Stakers_, who can be slashed in case of shortcoming of operational performance. _(Re)Stakers_ have to trust _Operators_ that they do their tasks according to the requirements stated by the _AVSs_. For economic stake, _(Re)Stakers_ can use; a) arbitrary ERC20 tokens, which also include Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), or b) Beacon Chain deposits to increase the capital efficiency of staked ETH.

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Eigenlayer protocol deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet achieves a _Low_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

Smart contracts that control user funds, the accounting of delegation, and slashing are fully _upgradeable_ and this can lead to _loss of user funds_ and _loss of unclaimed yield_.

Rewards committed by _AVSs_ to the `RewardsCoordinator` contract are distributed to _Operators_ and _Stakers_ via a merkle tree root posted by an account with the role `RewardsUpdater` , which computes eligibility for each _(Re)Staker_ and _Operator_ based on their stake and _AVS_ rewards specification. If an account with that role is compromised, the rewards can be distributed to the wrong addresses, which leads to _loss of unclaimed yield_.

The withdrawal process can be paused immediately by pausers registered in the `PauserRegistry` contract. Pausing can lead to temporary loss of access to funds, the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) however can resume the pause immediately if misused.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

The Eigenlayer protocol does not rely on a single _Operator_, nor on a single _AVS_ to work since it is a market place that brings _AVSs_ and _Operators_ together. Thus, the overall _Dependency_ risk is _low_. However, single _AVSs_ or _Operators_ can impose risks on each other and on _(Re)Stakers_ as the respective counterparties.

The [Dependencies](#dependencies) section goes into more detail about risks potentially originating from _AVSs_ and _Operators_.

> Autonomy score: Low

## Exit Window

### Upgrading Contracts

Upgrading of all upgradeable Eigenlayer smart contracts can be executed through the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council), which has two signers, the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council), which can execute immediately, and the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council). The [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) has an _Exit Window_ of 10 days before executing a call on the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council).

For the `bEIGEN` token (the backing token that is wrapped into `EIGEN` and used to control the `EIGEN` supply) there is a dedicated parallel upgrading process, which is also controlled by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer and a dedicated [bEIGEN TimelockController](#security-council) with an _Exit Window_ of 24 days.

### Pausing Strategy Contracts

Deposit contracts of economic stake (Strategies and EigenPods) can be paused immediately by pausers registered in the `PauserRegistry` contract which includes the [Pauser Multisig (1/6)](#security-council), the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council), and the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council). During a pause, the _(Re)Stakers_ cannot withdraw their funds. Resuming can only be enforced by the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) with a 10-day _Exit Window_ or immediately through the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer which adheres to the [Security Council Requirements](/framework#security-council-requirements).

### Rewards

The `RewardsUpdater` can immediately remove a root that holds the information of the weekly rewards and post a new root, claiming all deposited funds by _AVSs_ instead of distributing them to _Operators_ and _Stakers_. Immediate _loss of unclaimed yield_ leads to _Medium_ _Exit Window_ score.

### Overall Exit Window

The worst _Exit Window_ score of the different vectors is _High_. Immediate upgrade of contracts can only be executed by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) signer, thus the _Exit Window_ score is _High_. However, the impact on the total score is _Medium_ (_Stage 1_), as the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council) satisfies the [Security Council Requirements](/framework#security-council-requirements). Multisigs that are not compliant with the [Security Council Requirements](/framework#security-council-requirements) can initiate upgrades as well, but are protected by an _Exit Window_ of more than 7 days and can be overruled by the [Community Council (9/13)](#security-council).

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

There are no other frontends available for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ to delegate and initiate withdrawal. The Eigenlayer protocol does not provide a frontend for _AVSs_ to manage their contracts as they can vary on a case by case basis.

For _Operators_ a CLI is available to interact with the Eigenlayer protocol, for configuration allocations, registering to _Operator Sets_ and configuration of rewards. We argue that the option of a CLI is comparable to self hosting (_Medium_), because it's local, but not low risk, because if the CLI has a bug/vulnerability, as there is no diversity in terms of execution of the _Operator_ actions.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The Eigenlayer protocol achieves _High_ centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Exit Window_ and _Accessibility_ dimensions. It achieves _Low_ centralization risk scores for its _Autonomy_ and _Chain_ dimensions. Eigenlayer overall ranks _Stage 0_. The impact of the _Upgradeability_ and _Exit Window_ on the overall score is _Medium_ (_Stage 1_), because the permission owner satisfies the _Security Council Requirements_.

The protocol could reach _Stage 1_ by offering a self-hosting option for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ to manage their delegation and withdrawal.

The project additionally could advance to _Stage 2_ if alternative frontends are available for _Stakers_, _Restakers_ and _Operators_ to manage their delegation, withdrawal and participation in _Operator Sets_. Additionally it is required that the _Upgradeability_ is protected by 30 days _Exit Window_.

# Reviewer's Notes

- _Stakers_ denote users that deposit general ERC20 tokens in Eigenlayer to secure AVSs. _Restakers_ denote users that secure _AVSs_ by making Beacon Chain deposits slashable via Eigenlayer.
- _AVSs_ are required to deploy their own smart contracts which interact with the Eigenlayer smart contracts. These smart contracts are not part of the Eigenlayer protocol and thus are not part of this review.

# Protocol Analysis

![Eigenlayer](../diagrams/eigenlayer-overview.png)

The top-left shows the governance module. Arrows from the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) mostly denote upgrading power or upgrading calls through the `ProxyAdmin` located below.

Left-middle shows the strategy contracts module. There are two types of strategy contracts. Strategy contracts created by users through the factory, they are denoted as `StrategyBaseBeaconProxy` (this contract is deployed for each token, only one is shown). `StrategyTVLLimits` are contracts that were deployed initially and there is one contract per Liquid Staked Token (LST), only one is shown. Both type of contracts and each instance store ERC20 _(Re)Staker_ funds that are referenced from the `StrategyManager`.

Center is the heart-piece of Eigenlayer the `DelegationManager`. The `DelegationManager` interacts with the `StrategyManager` and the `EigenPodManager` below left and below right. These contracts store information on the deposited tokens and restaked Beacon Chain ETH. Above of the `DelegationManager` is the `AllocationManager` which is the contract with which _Operators_ and _AVSs_ allocate and slash staked assets. Next to `AllocationManager` is the `RewardsCoordinator` contract which allows _AVSs_ to post rewards, which then can be claimed by _Operators_ and _(Re)Stakers_ defined on agreed splits.

On the right hand side the contracts deployed by the _AVSs_ are denoted with the pointed box. The contracts by the _AVS_ are highly customizable. DApps possibly interact with this contracts denoted top right. The tasks that need to be validated/executed can then be picked up by _Operators_ from these contracts.

## Roles

### Stakers and Restakers

A _Staker_ or _Restaker_ is any user who has assets deposited (or "restaked") into EigenLayer (low center in the main diagram). They can stake multiple ERC20 assets that are accepted as _Economic Security_ or restake Beacon Chain ETH to secure _AVSs_.

The _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ have the following actions available; 1) deposit assets into EigenLayer via either the `StrategyManager` (for ERC20s) or the `EigenPodManager` (for Beacon Chain ETH), 2) withdraw assets via the `DelegationManager`, no matter what assets they're withdrawing, 3) delegate to an _Operator_ via the `DelegationManager`, 4) undelegating from an _Operator_ via the `DelegationManager`, 5) and claiming rewards posted by _AVSs_ from the `RewardsCoordinator` contract.

### Operators

_Operators_ are entities that opt-in to _Operator Sets_ created by _AVSs_ to execute tasks for the _AVS_ (upper center in the main diagram). _Operators_ receive economic stake delegated by the _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ and take a cut from the weekly rewards issued by the _AVSs_ (default: 10% _Operator_, 90% _Stakers_ and _Restakers_). _Operators_ can also stake themselves, the roles are not mutually exclusive.

_Operators_ have the following actions available; 1) register and deregister to and from an _Operator Set_ via the `AllocationManager` contract, 2) allocate and deallocate delegated stake to and from the _Operator Set_ via the `AllocationManager`, 3) change the reward split via the `RewardsCoordinator` contract, 4) claim rewards posted by _AVSs_ from the `RewardsCoordinator` contract, and 5) change the allocation delay via the `AllocationManager` contract, this affects the delay until the allocation becomes slashable upon allocation.

For conditions and timelines on (de)registering and (de)allocation read the [AllocationManager](#allocationmanager) contract section.

### AVSs

_AVSs_ are entities and protocols that offer services to their end users (e.g. Cryptographic Services, Data Availability, Bridging, Oracles, etc.). These services require task execution by an economically secured and distributed set of nodes, such as a PoS system. This task is required to be objective and verifiable; _Operators_ from the Eigenlayer marketplace opt-in to execute this task such that the _AVS_ can offer its service. Eigenlayer helps thus to make Beacon-Chain deposits more economically efficient by allowing _ETH Stakers_ to restake this economic stake to secure also other services that require validation. Additionally, _Stakers_ can also use arbitrary ERC20 tokens that are accepted by _AVSs_, which includes LSTs.

_AVSs_ are required to deploy their own smart contracts which interact with the Eigenlayer smart contracts (right hand side in the main diagram). The details of the implementation are free to choose by the _AVS_, but they must implement the following functions or manually perform them:

- provide a callback to the `AVSRegistrar` contract to notify the `AllocationManager` if the registration and deregistration by the _Operator_ is accepted (allows whitelisting, or parameter based acceptance, e.g type of stake etc.)
- create _Operator Sets_ (calling `createOperatorSets` or `createRedistributingOperatorSet` on the `AllocationManager` contract)
- slash operators (calling `slashOperator` on the `AllocationManager` contract)
- supply and post rewards for _Operators_ and _Stakers_ (calling `createOperatorDirectedOperatorSetRewardsSubmission` on the `RewardsCoordinator` contract)
- to allow registered operators to post results
- various functions to update and configure _Operator Sets_.

Additionally, _AVSs_ can increase fairness and transparency guarantees by; 1) allowing the Operators to veto a slash (Governance contract that calls `slashOperator` on the `AllocationManager` contract), 2) create protocols to eject _Operators_ (Governance contract that calls `deregisterFromOperatorSets` on the `AllocationManager` contract), 3) to create quorums for task submission or veto and 4) to compute rewards onchain instead of offchain (Smart Contract computing rewards and posting them to the `RewardsCoordinator` contract instead of multisigs/EOAs).

Regarding rewards, _AVSs_ are free to design their own reward logic, whether it is based on offchain or onchain data, and can distribute rewards in any ERC20 token. For instance, an _AVS_ can distribute a flat rate of rewards or a performance-based reward structure that is dependent on the work performed by _Operators_ within a certain time period. Additionally, an _AVS_ can submit multiple reward submissions, denominated in different tokens.

Repositories that help _AVSs_ to implement their contracts are:

- https://github.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli

## Important Eigenlayer Contracts and Concepts

### Strategies and EigenPods

Each asset that is accepted as _Economic Security_ to secure _AVSs_ is held in a separate contract, with exception of restaked `ETH` that remains on the Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer of Ethereum).

The three types of contracts that are used are:

1. **EigenPods**: These contracts are directly connected to the Beacon Chain and they are responsible for managing the deposit/withdrawal of Beacon Chain deposits. Each _Restaker_ deploys its own `EigenPod` contract via the `EigenPodManager` contract. The `EigenPod` validates a proof that the withdrawal credentials point to this contract, such that the Eigenlayer protocol can facilitate slashing by _AVSs_.
2. **Legacy Strategy Contracts**: These contracts are transparent upgradeable proxy contracts that each hold liquid staking ETH tokens. Each contract needs to be upgraded separately by the `ProxyAdmin` contract.
3. **Factory based Strategy Contracts**: These contracts are instantiated through the `StrategyFactory` and are responsible for managing tokens added by users themselves. These contracts are upgradeable and share the same implementation contract (beacon proxy), which allows to update the contracts all at once.

An upgrade of any of the three contract types could lead to _loss of funds_ if compromised.

The `StrategyFactory` creates new strategies (ie allows to accept new ERC20 tokens as security), with the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) controlling strategy whitelisting and blacklisting, which corresponds to whitelisting/blacklisting ERC20 tokens as _Economic Security_ for _AVSs_. When a _Strategy_ is removed from the whitelist or blacklisted, _Stakers_ can still withdraw or delegate existing funds, but new deposits are blocked. By default, new strategies created by the factory are whitelisted. Staked capital that is in blacklisted strategies can still earn rewards, it is up to the _AVS_ to postpone or omit rewards for these strategies. However, the [rewardsUpdater](#security-council) can still post a root to a tree that excludes rewards based on this blacklisted strategy and overrule _AVSs_.

### EigenPods

EigenPods are the contracts that point to Beacon Chain deposits and make them slashable by _AVSs_. To create deposit shares in the `EigenPodManager` contract, which then can be used to delegate to _Operators_ and earn additional rewards from the _AVSs_, a proof of the withdrawal credentials pointing to the `EigenPod` contract address supplied by the _Restaker_ and owner of the `EigenPod` is required.

If a _Restaker_ wants to withdraw their funds from the Beacon Chain, they need to start a checkpoint and verify the checkpoint to update their shares in the `EigenPodManager` based on validator rewards they received on the Beacon Chain. Additional shares from validator rewards can be withdrawn or used to delegate to _Operators_. Reduced Beacon Chain deposits through validator slashing, lead to a reduction of the shares. To withdraw ETH from the Beacon Chain, _Restakers_ can use the EIP-7002 execution layer triggereable withdrawals, via calling `requestWithdrawal` on the `EigenPod` contract, or use the Consensus Layer primary key to initiate the withdrawal to the Execution Layer (Ethereum Mainnet). To be able to withdraw the ETH deposited in the `EigenPod` contract through the previous step, _Restakers_ need to queue and complete a withdrawal with the `DelegationManager` contract. (see [DelegationManager](#delegationmanager))

Each `EigenPod` shares the same implementation contract, which allows to update the `EigenPods` contracts all at once by the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) with the Beacon-Proxy `UpgradeableBeacon` contract. A malicious upgrade could be used to add a function that allows to withdraw the ETH from the Beacon-Chain by using the EIP-7002 execution layer triggereable withdrawals to a malicious address. However, updates like this can be cancelled by the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council), which is one of the signers in the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council).

The starting of checkpoints and their verification can be paused by the pausers. A permanent pause of the withdrawal process leads to _loss of funds_ for the _Restakers_.

![Eigenpod](../diagrams/eigenlayer-eigenpod.png)

### DelegationManager

After users first deposit into the strategies or EigenPods (and the `StrategyManager` and `EigenPodManager` keep track of the deposit shares). The `DelegationManager` is the contract that allows _(Re)Stakers_ to delegate their stake to _Operators_. The `DelegationManager` fetches the amount of deposit shares from the `StrategyManager` or `EigenPodManager` contract, and the scaling factor (how many _AVS_ slashes suffered) from the `AllocationManager` contract to set the starting point for the _(Re)Stakers_.

![Delegation](../diagrams/eigenlayer-delegation.png)

Withdrawal as a _Staker_ or _Restaker_ is only possible through the `DelegationManager` contract. When withdrawing the _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ receive the amount of deposit shares minus the amount of slashes suffered by the _AVS_ during their delegation. This amount of tokens are called withdrawable shares.

Withdrawal is a 2-step process which requires a `queueWithdrawal` and a `completeQueuedWithdrawal` call to the `DelegationManager` contract. The `queueWithdrawal` call is required to initiate the withdrawal process, and the `completeQueuedWithdrawal` call is required to complete the withdrawal process. The `completeQueuedWithdrawal` call is only possible after a cooldown period (14 days) is over. During this two step process, sufferred slashes by _AVS_ are taken into account to calculate the final amount of ETH or tokens to be sent to the _(Re)Staker_.

_Operators_ can configure a _Delegation Approver_, that requires _Stakers_ to first get an approval before they may delegate to the _Operator_ through the `DelegationManager` contract. This way, _Operators_ can prevent _Stakers_ from delegating their funds to them and keep a privileged set of _Stakers_. If the _Delegation Approver_ is set to the 0-address, any _Staker_ can delegate their stake to the respective _Operator_.

The `DelegationManager` contract also allows users to register as _Operators_ in the Eigenlayer system, which is a requirement for _Operators_ to register in _Operator Sets_ created by _AVSs_.

The `DelegationManager` contract's _Upgradeability_ through the `ProxyAdmin` contract introduces an _Upgradeability_ risk, as the upgrade could potentially modify core delegation logic, the slashing accounting and thus lead to _loss of funds_ of _(Re)Stakers_ if the upgrade is malicious or faulty, as _(Re)Stakers_ initiate withdrawals of funds through this contract.

Delegation, undelegation, withdrawal (queueing and completion) and registration as _Operators_ can be paused by the pausers. A permanent pause of the withdrawal process can lead to _loss of funds_ for the _Restakers_ and _Stakers_.

### AllocationManager

Through the `AllocationManager` the `AVSs` can manage _Operator Sets_ (creation and changes) and AVS configurations as metadata. The `AllocationManager` allows _Operators_ to allocate and deallocate from _Operator Sets_ and _AVSs_. _Operator Sets_ are isolated pools of staked capital that serve as economic security for an _AVS_. _Operator Sets_ allow _AVSs_ to differentiate different _Operators_ with regarding to their business requirements and type of stake. Also _AVSs_ can slash certain strategies within an _Operator Set_ and issue rewards in a granular way for each supplied strategy within the _Operator Set_. Slashing is done when the _Operators_ break a certain committments to the _AVS_. _AVSs_ can slash _Operators_ up to the full stake inside the _Operator Sets_. The `AllocationManager` contract forwards the slashing request by the _AVSs_ to the `DelegationManager` contract, to reduce the delegated amount of the _Operators_.

_Operators_ can change their allocation delay which is the duration until which the new allocated stake becomes slashable. A change of allocation delay registered by _Operator_ takes 17.5 days (ALLOCATION_CONFIGURATION_DELAY) until it is effective.

The duration until a deallocation is effective (the capital is not slashable anymore) takes 14 days (DEALLOCATION_DELAY). This is only changeable through an upgrade of the `AllocationManager` contract. Deallocation cannot be prevented by the AVS.

Registering and deregistering by an _Operator_ from an _Operator Set_ has to be accepted by the _AVS_. The _AVSs_ can setup an `AVSRegistrar` contract, which is called by the `AllocationManager` when _Operators_ register to and deregister from _Operator Sets_. If the _AVS_ does not have an `AVSRegistrar` set, the `AllocationManager` will forward the call to the registered _AVS_ contract itself. If the `AVSRegistrar` or the registered _AVS_ contract reverts the transaction, the `AllocationManager` will revert the transaction as well, and _Operators_ will not be able to register to or deregister from _Operator Sets_. This can create unfair scenarios, where _AVSs_ allow opt-in, but disallow opt-out (see [dependencies](#dependencies) for risks steming from _AVSs_).

The contract's _Upgradeability_ through the `ProxyAdmin` contract introduces an _Upgradeability_ risk, as the upgrade could potentially modify slashing logic and the slashing accounting and thus lead to _loss of funds_ of _(Re)Stakers_ if the upgrade is malicious or faulty, as the `DelegationManager` contract is informed on suffered slashes by the `AllocationManager` contract.

Registration and deregistration of _Operators_ from _Operator Sets_, modification of allocations to _Operator Sets_ by _Operators_, and slashing by _AVSs_ can be paused by the pausers. A pause of deregistration and modification of allocations, but not slashing, could lead to an unfair situation for _Operators_ and _Stakers_.

![Slashing](../diagrams/eigenlayer-slashing.png)

### RewardsCoordinator

The `RewardsCoordinator` contract holds reward funds sent by the _AVSs_ which will be distributed to _Operators_ and _Stakers_. By default, _Operators_ receive 10% and _Stakers_ 90% of the rewards distributed by the _AVSs_. The _Operators_ can change the reward split by calling `setOperatorAVSSplit`.

The `rewardsUpdater` EOA calculates rewards offchain and consolidates these into a merkle root posted onchain by calling the `submitRoot` function. The reward amounts are calculated based on the supplied rewards and the arguments supplied with calling `createOperatorDirectedOperatorSetRewardsSubmission` such as start time, duration, distribution among strategies inside the operator set, token, amounts and operators by _AVSs_. This function also transfers the ERC20 tokens to the `RewardsCoordinator` contract. Rewards are posted every week, rewards that should be applied to the next claiming period have to be posted by _AVSs_ at least 48h before root submission.

The `disableRoot` function can be called by the `rewardsUpdater` to disable the current root and prevent further distributions. If the `disableRoot` function is called, _Operators_ and _Stakers_ cannot further claim their rewards and rely on the Eigenlayer protocol to re-enable the reward distribution mechanism, by posting a new root.

This means the `rewardsUpdater` role must be completely trusted in the distribution of rewards. Malicious behavior by the Eigenlayer protocol could lead to _loss of unclaimed yield_. The [Operator Multisig](#security-council) can appoint a new `rewardsUpdater` in case of compromised or malicious behavior.

Rewards are distributed periodically, with a delay period of 7 days before they become claimable.

The _Upgradeability_ of the `RewardsCoordinator`, controlled by the `ProxyAdmin`, means that deposited funds by _AVSs_ could be withdrawn and stolen which leads to _loss of unclaimed yield_ for both _Stakers_ and _Operators_. Additionally, the 90/10 default split between _Stakers_ and _Operators_ can be modified with a delay of 7 days.

Setting the split between _Stakers_ and _Operators_, claiming of rewards can be paused by the pausers. A pause of claiming rewards could lead to _loss of unclaimed yield_ for both _Stakers_ and _Operators_.

### PermissionController

The `PermissionController` is a contract that allows _AVSs_ and _Operators_ to appoint general admins to call functions on the `AllocationManager` and `DelegationManager` contracts or appointees (can call only selected addresses and functions) on behalf of them.

The _Upgradeability_ of the `PermissionController`, controlled by the `ProxyAdmin`, means that permissions to slash operators on behalf of AVS (as an appointee) can be hijacked by a permission owner going rogue, leading to _loss of funds_ for _Stakers_ and loss of delegated stake for _Operators_.

### PauserRegistry

The `PauserRegistry` contract informs all pausable contracts, who can pause, and who can unpause. The [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) can assign pausing rights to new accounts. [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) as one of the signers of the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) can resume the paused actions.

### EIGEN and bEIGEN

`bEIGEN` is used to control the supply of `EIGEN` and will serve in the future as intersubjective work token that can be slashed via forking, while `EIGEN` remains slashing unaware to maintain DeFi compatibility (learn more [here](https://blog.eigencloud.xyz/eigen/)).

`EIGEN` tokens are created by supplying and wrapping `BackingEigen` (or denoted as `bEIGEN`) tokens into the `EIGEN` token contract through the `wrap` function.

The `BackingEigen` token contract is upgradeable, which means that the permissions to upgrade the token contract can have an impact on user funds, such as dilution or change of ownership. New minters of `bEIGEN` can be appointed with the `setIsMinter` function, which could lead to malicious minters mis-using this minting right to wrap it into `EIGEN` tokens.

Currently `bEIGEN` is minted by the Eigenlayer protocol through the `TokenHopper` contract, which mints `bEIGEN` tokens, wraps them into `EIGEN` tokens and deposits them into the `RewardsCoordinator` contract through by calling `createRewardsForAllEarners`. This inflation serves as Programmatic Incentives (PI).

### Programmatic Incentives

Programmatic Incentives (PI) are `EIGEN` tokens minted by the EigenLayer protocol and distributed to _(Re)Stakers_ and _Operators_ to incentivize and bootstrap participants in the Eigenlayer.

PI are distributed in `EIGEN` tokens minted by the Eigenlayer protocol and distributed to _(Re)Stakers_ and _Operators_ through the `RewardsCoordinator` contract. The permission owner to post the root is again the [rewardsUpdater](#security-council). Read more here on the emission schedule and emission amount in the [official docs](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/programmatic-incentives/programmatic-incentives-faq).

# Dependencies

The Eigenlayer protocol does not depend on a single _AVS_ or _Operator_. However, _AVSs_, _(Re)Stakers_ and _Operators_ depend on each other, and as such create dependency risks for each other.

The following subsections highlight risks potentially coming from _AVSs_ and _Operators_ for respective counterparties.

## AVSs

### Slashing Operators unfairly

The _AVSs_ can slash _Operators_ by specifying which _Operator_ and which _Strategies_ should be slashed and by which amount. This leads to _loss of funds_ for _(Re)Stakers_ and loss of delegated stake for _Operators_. The slashing can be fair (according to published terms by the _AVSs_) or unfair (not according to published terms by the _AVSs_ and supplied performance by the _Operator(s)_).

_AVSs_ are allowed to create _Operator Sets_ that have redistribution recipients, which receive the slashed amount instead of burning the slashed tokens. Thus slashing could be mis-used to steal the funds of the _(Re)Stakers_ delegated to the _Operators_. A non-redistributing _Operator Set_ cannot be transformed into a redistributing _Operator Set_.

### Preventing Deregistration of Operators from Operator Sets

Deregistration of _Operators_ from _Operator Sets_ can be prevented by _AVSs_ by reverting the callback `deregisterOperator` on the registered `AVSRegistrar` contract. This is a contract specific to each _AVS_ that is controlled by each _AVS_. This could open a greater time window for an _AVS_ to slash _Operators_ if deallocation is not triggered as a response. However, deallocation from the _Operator Set_ can not be prevented by the _AVSs_ and it always takes 14 days (DEALLOCATION_DELAY).

### Breaking Reward Promises

The _AVSs_ can post less rewards than promised to the `RewardsCoordinator` contract for the _Operators_ and _Stakers_, leading to worse yield performance than expected.

## Operators

### Change Reward Split

_Operators_ can change the reward split by calling `setOperatorAVSSplit` on the `RewardsCoordinator` contract. This could lead to reduced yield performance for _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ if the _Operator_ changes the split to their favor. It is only applied for the future and takes at least one week to be applied (set with global variable `activationDelay`).

### Slacking duty

Queued _Stakers_ and _Restakers_ are still subject to slashing for their delegated operator for 14 days after they queued their withdrawal, this makes them vulnerable to slacking operators that phase out or become unreliable, but only if the _Operator_ is registered for _AVSs_ that have mandatory duties (the type of tasks that the _Operator_ is required to perform by the _AVSs_ can have different modalities). This could lead to _loss of funds_ for _(Re)Stakers_.

# Governance

The [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) holds all permissions to upgrade contracts of the protocol through the `ProxyAdmin` contract or directly on the contracts themselves. The [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council)'s signers are the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) and the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council).

The [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) has two admins, the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) and the contract itself. Additionally three roles exist; proposer, canceler and executor. The proposers are the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) and the [Protocol Council (3/5)](#security-council), the canceler is the [Operations Multisig (3/6)](#security-council) and the executor is the [Protocol Council (3/5)](#security-council).

For the `bEIGEN` token there is a dedicated parallel upgrade process with the same roles and entities. Instead of the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) a dedicated [bEIGEN TimelockController](#security-council) with a sufficient _Exit Window_ of 24 days instead of 10 days is used.

## Protocol Council

The 3 out of 5 multisig has 2 signers from the Eigen Foundation and 3 external signers from the Eigenlayer ecosystem. The [Protocol Council (3/5)](#security-council) is responsible for executing proposals on the [Protocol TimelockController](#security-council) and [bEIGEN TimelockController](#security-council).

## Community Multisig

The [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) can execute calls through the [Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) and [bEIGEN Executor Multisig (1/2)](#security-council) without co-signer. This permission is designed for emergency situations and key compromises. This permission could technically be misused to steal funds from the Eigenlayer protocol with immediate effect (no exit window for the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council)), therefore distribution of signers across the ecosystem with long term alignment is important.

The [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) satisfies our [security council requirements](/framework#security-council-requirements).

Signers of the [Community Multisig (9/13)](#security-council) are

| DelegationManager (Proxy)              | changeAdmin                                        | The admin can upgrade the `DelegationManager` contract. The `DelegationManager` contract manages delegations from restakers to operators. Restakers that want to withdraw from active (delegated) positions, need to call this contract to withdraw their funds. If this contract is maliciously upgraded it could block withdrawal of user funds or change claimable funds and yield and thus it could lead to a loss of user funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                |

MIN_WITHDRAWAL_DELAY_BLOCKS is 14 days, and new withdrawals are delayed for the time of the pause + 14 days. The unpausing can happen immediately if signed by the Community Multisig, or if through normal process, takes at least 10 days because of the Exit Window in the TimelockController contract. For fairness, slashing inside AllocationManager should be paused as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Executor Multisig                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| DelegationManager (Implementation)     | modifyOperatorDetails                              | Allows an operator to change the `delegation approver` for the respective operator. If the delegation approver is set to the 0-address, any staker can delegate their stake to the respective operator. If a delegation approver is configured all new stakers need to get a signature from the approver first, before they can delegate to this operator. Funds of existing stakers are not blocked when the operator transitions to a delegation approver setting, but the approver can forcefully return the stake to the staker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | only registered Operators                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Once the period is finished, the staker can either allocate to a new operator, or withdraw the ETH from their `EigenPod` contract, once the ETH is sent back from the CL to the EL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | DelegationManager                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A user starts this interaction by calling `completeQueuedWithdrawal` on the `DelegationManager` contract. In order for this function to succeed, the `EigenPod` contract must have received the ETH from the Beacon Chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | DelegationManager                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Already set reward roots are not affected by the new activation delay. The new delay has to be set before the submission of the root. If the root is invalidated, and re-submitted, the new delay would take in immediate effect. A unreasonable long delay would technically mean loss of funds (max timestamp of the the storage value is the year 2106).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Operations Multisig                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The new default split is applied for the next root if before 2 days of the next root posting (calculation delay), but this is not strictly enforced as the computation is done offchain, thus it could be technically applied with the next root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Operations Multisig                                                                                                                                                                                       |

To register these changes, the EigenPod owner or the ProofSubmitter need to call this function which stores beacon block root, the ETH balance of the EigenPod, the number of validators for which a proof needs to be submitted. In a second step the EigenPod owner or the ProofSubmitter need to call `verifyCheckpointProofs` (function is permissionless) which arguments includes beacon balance container proof and a proof of this root and proof, as well as pubkeys, balance roots and proofs. The function then computes all the deltas of each registered validator for this EigenPod, if the delta is positive, the EigenPod receives more shares which are delegated to the current operator, if the delta is negative, the EigenPod loses shares which are delegated to the current operator. | EigenPod owner or ProofSubmitter                                                                                                                                                                          |

An upgrade can lead to maliciously allowing addresses to act on behalf of operators and AVSs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                |
