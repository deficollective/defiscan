## Upgradeability

In the upgradability section & risk we address bytecode upgrades and parameter changes that are permissioned.

We wrote a section explaining the Upgradeability Risk in our framework here: See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#upgradability

For some practical guidance follow this steps. It will help you in writing a nice report:

1. Run the [permission scanner](https://github.com/deficollective/permission-scanner)
2. Fill in all the permissioned functions in the table (`## Permissions`)
   - Remember: Each function with a permission needs to be considered when determining the risk on Upgradability
3. Get a mechanistic and precise understanding of each permissioned function
4. Assess impact for each function, look out for
   - loss/blocking of user funds
   - loss of unclaimed yield
   - change expected behavior significantly (blacklisting/kyc/fees/...)
5. Write the impact column based on your understanding
   - A good tipp when writing the impact column below, think of least 2,3 sentences:
   1. First sentence: what it does technically, e.g "It assigns a new address to the owner variable"
   2. Second: what is the impact within the system, e.g "The owner is permissioned to raise fees"
   3. Third: Imagine faulty or malicious action, e.g "The malicious owner could raise fees to 100%, redirecting all future yield.
6. Summarise and abstract away technical details in this section here (`## Upgradeability`)

> Upgradeability score: Low/Medium/High

## Autonomy

## Conclusion

Some text in form of:

The xyz protocol achieves High centralization risk scores for its Upgradeability, Autonomy and Exit Window dimensions. It thus ranks Stage 0.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by ...

The project additionally could advance to Stage 2 if ...

# Reviewer's Notes

(Here, anything worth mentioning about what critical permissions you excluded from the scope or some elements that xyz protocol does in a unique way. If nothing seems relevant, just say that :)

⚠️ During our analysis, we identified ...

# Protocol Analysis

- PermissionController is a contract that allows AVS and Operators to appoint admins and appointees for certain targets and calls
- PermissionController is upgradeable, meaning permissions to slash operators on behalf of AVS can be hijacked by a permission owner going rogue
- Strategy contract hold funds and are upgradeable and pausable, thus can lead to complete loss of funds for restakers, loss of economic security for AVS and backing of Operators
- DelegationManager, StrategyManager, AllocationManager and RewardsCoordinator are all upgradeable
- AVS Registrar deregisterOperator call needs to succeed for an operator to opt out of an operator set. Can lead to operator being locked inside AVS and being slashable. (setAVSRegistrar)
- Operators are trapped and can be slashed, if deregistration of operators from operatorsets is paused, but AVSs still slash.

Here anything relevant to the governance, in this case it could be what you highlighted in "Upgrade Process"

Changing the admin transfers the right to upgrade the contract. This has to be executed with care, because the `PermissionController` stores permissions to act on behalf of operators (joining operator sets) and of behalf of AVS (slashing operators, or allowing new strategies, ie tokens). An upgrade can lead to maliciously allowing addresses to act on behalf of operators and AVSs.                                                             | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                   |
