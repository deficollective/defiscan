# Summary

Uniswap v2 is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates token swaps and liquidity provision without intermediaries. It introduced several key features, including the ability to create liquidity pools for any two ERC-20 tokens, flash swaps for borrowing assets without upfront capital, and time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles for reliable, manipulation-resistant pricing.
The protocol is deployed across multiple chains, enhancing accessibility and enabling seamless token exchanges in diverse blockchain ecosystems. Uniswap v2 continues to play a foundational role in decentralized finance by supporting a wide range of trading pairs and enabling innovative DeFi strategies.

# Overview

## Chain

Uniswap v-2 is deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon,Base, BNB, Avalanche C-Chain, CELO, Blast, ZKsync, Zora and WorldChain. 
This analysis is based on the contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

## Upgradeability

Uniswap V3 maintains a structure where some contracts retain the ability to upgrade or transfer ownership, while others are effectively immutable. The UniswapV3Factory contract has two key permissions, setOwner and enableFeeAmount, both of which are controlled by the Timelock contract at 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC. This setup allows for governance to add new fee tiers or transfer ownership of the factory. However, critical pool-level permissions like setFeeProtocol and collectProtocol are owned by the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000), making these functions permanently unusable.
The protocol employs proxy contracts managed through ProxyAdmin, also owned by the Timelock, allowing for upgrades to the implementation contracts. These proxies retain the ability to upgrade via the upgrade and upgradeAndCall functions, which are critical permissions. While these functions do not directly affect user funds, they carry risks of introducing unintended system behavior if misused.

> Upgradeability score: M


## Autonomy

Uniswap V3 operates independently, with no reliance on external oracles, DeFi protocols, or cross-chain infrastructure. This self-sufficiency minimizes risks from external disruptions, ensuring stable performance.

> Autonomy score: L



## Exit Window

The permissions for Uniswap V3 are managed by a Timelock contract (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC), which enforces a 2-day delay on queued transactions, with a 14-day grace period. However, the 2-day delay is insufficient for users to respond effectively to unwanted changes, leaving permissions inadequately protected.

> Exit Window score: H


## Accessibility

Uniswap V3 offers a primary user interface hosted on its official platform, with the source code available publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface)
 for self-hosting. This ensures that users can deploy their own interface in case of a shutdown of the official website. However, the reliance on a single main interface without other independent platforms or in-wallet integrations limits access options in the event of unexpected downtime.

> Accessibility score: M

| UniswapV3Factory                    	| setOwner      	| The setOwner function allows the current owner of the IUniswapV3Factory contract to transfer ownership to a new address (_owner).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	| 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC |
| UniswapV3Factory                    	| enableFeeAmount   | The enableFeeAmount function allows the owner of the IUniswapV3Factory contract to define a new fee tier and its corresponding tick spacing for Uniswap pools. It verifies that the caller is the owner, that the fee is under 1,000,000, that the tick spacing is within a safe range (1 to 16,383), and that the fee hasn't been set previously. Once these conditions are met, it assigns the tick spacing to the specified fee and emits a FeeAmountEnabled event to record the new fee configuration.                                                                                                                          	| 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC |
| UniswapV3Factory(UniswapV3Pool)     	| setFeeProtocol	| The setFeeProtocol function enables the factory owner to adjust protocol fees for each token in the pool, within a range of 4 to 10, or set them to zero. Risk is high, since changing fee levels can impact the returns for liquidity providers, affecting their incentives and overall protocol stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	| 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| UniswapV3Factory(UniswapV3Pool)     	| collectProtocol   | The collectProtocol function allows the owner to collect protocol fees accumulated in the pool, transferring them to the designated address. Risk is high, as mismanagement or exploitation of this function could lead to the loss of collected funds, compromising the protocol's reserves and liquidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	| 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |

| TransparentUpgradeableProxy         	| upgradeTo     	| This function upgrades the implementation of the proxy to a new contract address. The implementation is the core logic of the proxy, and changing it alters how the proxy behaves. The main risk of this function is that setting a faulty or malicious implementation could introduce vulnerabilities, allow attackers to exploit the contract, result in the loss or freezing of user funds, or render the contract unusable.                                                                                                                                                                                                     	| Icant' find admin                      	|
| TransparentUpgradeableProxy         	| upgradeToAndCall  | This function upgrades the proxy's implementation to a new contract address and immediately calls a function on the new implementation using the provided encoded data. This is useful for initializing new state variables or configurations during an upgrade. However, combining an upgrade with a function call increases the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities, especially if the encoded data contains errors or malicious logic. This could compromise the proxy’s functionality, security, or the integrity of its stored state.                                                                                  	| Icant' find admin                      	|

## Dependencies


Uniswap V3 is designed to function autonomously without dependencies on external oracles, other DeFi protocols, specific assets, other DEXs, cross-chain bridges, or cross-chain infrastructure. This design enhances its resilience and reduces potential points of failure.



## Exit Window

The permissions for Uniswap V3 are controlled primarily by the Timelock contract at address 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC, which acts as the owner of most critical functions. For other functions, the owner is set to 0x0. However, this Timelock contract provides only a 2-day delay for queued transactions, which is insufficient for users to respond adequately to potential unwanted updates. Additionally, although there is a 14-day grace period, this remains below the optimal level for robust exit protection.

# Security Council
Uniswap V3 does not require a Security Council because it uses a Timelock contract instead of a multisig. Governance decisions are made through on-chain voting by UNI token holders, with the Timelock enforcing a delay before executing changes. This decentralized process places control in the hands of the community, providing transparency and protection without the need for a separate council.
