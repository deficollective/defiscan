# Summary

Aave v3 is a lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow different ERC20 assets. This review focuses on the Arbitrum deployment of Aave v3.

Aave v3 on Arbitrum uses for most the same contract code as Aave v3 Core on Ethereum mainnet instance. The Aave DAO deployed the _Lend & Borrow_, the _Reserve Parameters_ and the _Treasury, Aave Ecosystem Reserves & Rewards_ modules to offer the same functionality on Arbitrum.

We only report on the specific differences in this report, to understand the redeployed and re-used modules check out our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Aave V3 instance deployed on Arbitrum. Arbitrum achieves a _Medium_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Medium

## Upgradeability

The permissions and _Upgradeability_ in the re-deployed contracts of the modules _Core Lend & Borrow_, _Reserve Parameters_, _Treasury, Aave Ecosystem Reserves & Rewards_ are the same to the Aave v3 Core instance.

### GHO Stablecoin

GHO is created on Ethereum Mainnet, but can be bridged to Arbitrum through Chainlink's CCIP (see [Autonomy section](#autonomy) for more details). The [Risk Council](#security-council) for Gho on Arbitrum, has permissions to configure the GHO CCIP Token Pool on Arbitrum, which mints GHO to the receiving user address, when a user locks an equivalent amount of GHO on Ethereum Mainnet. The configuration entails rate limiting and bridge limiting (total amount of GHO on Arbitrum). These configuration parameters are handled by the projects themselves and not by CCIP/Chainlink. The [Risk Council](#security-council) furthermore can update the bucket capacity of listed facilitators. Facilitators in GHO are contracts that are allowed to mint and burn GHO. The only listed facilitator on Arbitrum is the GHO CCIP Token Pool.

The [Risk Council](#security-council) could temporarily block GHO cross-chain by setting low rate limiting, or setting the facilitator capacity below the current Arbitrum issuance, preventing new minting on Arbitrum even if users are currently bridging GHO from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum. This could lead to _temporarily loss of funds_. The _Aave Governance_ can restore user funds on Ethereum Mainnet with the permission to release GHO tokens from the corresponding mainnet GHO CCIP pool.

The _Aave Governance_ can upgrade the GHO contract, which is unlike the Ethereum Mainnet instance not immutable. Additionally the _Aave Governance_ can add or remove facilitators that can mint or burn GHO. This could open the possibility of uncontrolled minting or burning of GHO in case of an unintended upgrade. If abused, this control thus introduces a risk of _loss of funds_, _loss of unclaimed yield_ (accrued interest in GHO) or an otherwise _material impact on the expected protocol performance_ for GHO holders and Aave users.

### Aave Governance

The _Aave Governance_ on Arbitrum is unlike the _Aave Governance_ on Ethereum mainnet only for execution of registered and voted payloads. Aave DAO voters cannot vote on Arbitrum. The setup of the executor, time exit and bridging votes from Mainnet to Arbitrum has been discussed in our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

### CCIP

GHO on arbitrum solely relies on CCIP for bridging native GHO from Ethereum. Chainlink CCIP achieves a _High_ centralization risk score as discussed in a separate report [here](/protocols/ccip/mainnet).

### Risk Oracle

Next to handing some control over market parameters to the [Risk Council](#security-council) via steward contracts, the Aave V3 instance on Arbitrum automates the borrow and supply cap automatically by handing off the exact values to a risk oracle implemented by Chaos Labs (service provider to the DAO). The Risk Oracle by Chaos Labs receives a _High centralization_ rating but the `EdgeRiskSteward` makes sure the values submitted by the `RiskOracle` contract are within guardrails to prevent abusive behavior. Upon failure of the `RiskOracle`, the [Risk Council](#security-council) can still update borrow and supply caps. No additional dependency risk is introduced by using the Risk Oracle provided by Chaos Labs.

> Autonomy score: high

## Exit Window

The Aave v3 instance on Arbitrum uses the same exit window as the Aave v3 Core instance on Ethereum mainnet.

Read more in our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Aave V3 deployment on Arbitrum is accessible through the same Aave UI and third party UIs than the Aave v3 Core instance.

Read more in our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

> Accessibility score: low

## Conclusion

The Aave v3 Arbitrum deployment achieves _High_ centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Autonomy_ and _Exit Window_ dimensions. It thus ranks **Stage 0**.

The protocol could reach **Stage 1** by; 1) adopting the security council requirements for the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig account and 2) implementing fallback mechanism around the Chainlink oracle (or Chainlink adopting a _Security Council_ setup for its own multisig account).

The project additionally could advance to **Stage 2** if all critical permissions were assigned to _Aave Governance_ and protected with a 30-day _Exit Window_.

# Reviewer Notes

⚠️ During our analysis, we identified a unverified role (not mentioned in the docs https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-permissions-book/blob/main/out/ARBITRUM_ONE-V3.md#admins). Role Id is 0xd1d2cf869016112a9af1107bcf43c3759daf22cf734aad47d0c9c726e33bc782. The owners of this role are related to the V2 to V3 migration.

# Protocol Analysis

## Upgradeable Pool Contract and mutable reserve parameters

The only notable distinction between the Lending logic on Ethereum L1 and a L2 is the existence and reliance on the `PriceOracleSentinel` contract which prevents liquidations when the sequencer of a L2 is down, in this case the sequencer of Arbitrum. This is an additional safety mechanism and does not introduce any dependency risk.

![Lending](../diagrams/aave-v3-arbitrum-lending.png)

A second notable distinction between Aave on Arbitrum and Aave on Ethereum Core, is the automation of risk parameters via the Risk Oracle. The Risk Oracle pushes parameters based on quantitative risk models, to optimize performance under current market risk. The values fetched from the Risk Oracle have to meet the criteria by the EdgeRiskSteward, which prevents excessive and malicious parameter updates.

![Parameter Control](../diagrams/aave-v3-arbitrum-parameter.png)

## GHO

GHO is minted and issued on Ethereum mainnet based on crypto collateral. In order to expand the reach of GHO into Arbitrum, CCIP token bridge is used. When GHO is locked in the CCIP token pool on Ethereum mainnet, an equivalent amount minus fees is minted on Arbitrum. The CCIP token bridge is the solely bridge that is permissioned to bridge GHO. To release GHO on mainnet, the GHO tokens have to be returned into the GHO CCIP token pool on Arbitrum and are burned.

# Dependencies

## Risk Oracle

Besides the [Risk Council](#security-council) having control over market parameters via steward contracts, the Aave V3 instance on Arbitrum automates the borrow and supply cap automatically by handing off the updates of this caps to a risk oracle implemented by Chaos Labs (service provider to the DAO). This allows automatic updates of these risk parameters based on risk models in real time. `EdgeRiskSteward` makes sure the values submitted by the `RiskOracle` contract are within guardrails to prevent abusive behavior by malicious intent.

## Price Oracle Sentinel

Aave V3 instances on Layer 2s make use of the Sequencer oracle offered by Chainlink. This oracle informs smart contracts whether the sequencer of the respective rollup is currently offline. Sophisticated actors can force transactions on native rollups via posting them directly on Ethereum mainnet. To prevent sophisticated actors to liquidate users during sequencer downtime, Aave implemented the `PriceOracleSentinel` contract that prevents liquidations, if the Chainlink _L2 Sequencer Uptime Oracle_ reports downtime of the sequencer. The _L2 Sequencer Uptime Oracle_ was assessed to be highly centralized as written in this [report](/protocols/chainlink-sequencer-oracles/ethereum).

If this sequencer oracle does not report sequencer downtime, the protection for non-sophisticated users fails. If the oracle reports downtime even if there is no downtime, the system's capability for liquidations is un-necessarily blocked for the grace period (1 hour). This grace period can be set to 0, if the oracle is permanently misbehaving or out of order. Even if the _L2 Sequencer Uptime Oracle_ by Chainlink fails the protocol impact on users is marginal, thus the reliance on the dependency is low and as such the Dependency risk is _Low_.

## CCIP for GHO

The GHO tokens on Arbitrum are bridged from Mainnet via CCIP. CCIP stands for Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol and is a protocol and product by Chainlink.

The GHO tokens are bridged by lock/release mechanism on mainnet, and a mint/burn mechanism on Arbitrum. In the case of GHO a user locks GHO on mainnet, and an equivalent amount gets minted by the GHO contract on Arbitrum. The GHO token on Arbitrum, unlike the GHO token on mainnnet, is upgradeable.

Chainlink CCIP is covered in more detail in our separate report [here](/protocols/ccip/mainnet).

## Layer 1 Governance

Aave V3 on Arbitrum relies on the governance smart contracts on Ethereum Mainnet and bridging votes from Polygon to mainnet. See the mainnet core instance report for a detailed system breakdown and analysis [here](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

# Governance

Community vote is enforced on Arbitrum through the following process:

1. The community registers a payload at the `PayloadsController` contract on Arbitrum
2. The community starts a vote on the Governance contract on Ethereum Mainnet specififying Arbitrum and the payload Id
3. The vote starts after 1 day delay and gets ported via a.DI to a voting network (currently Polygon)
4. When the vote has passed, the result is transferred back to Ethereum Mainnet
5. The vote can be executed. The call to execute the payload is bridged to Arbitrums PayloadController
6. After the Exit Window has passed, the community can trigger execution.

| Pool (Proxy) (InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy)       | upgradeTo                              | This function allows the permission owner to set a new implementation contract to forward calls to. This can change the whole pool implementation logic and thus can affect deposits, collateral and unclaimed yield. The function on `PoolAddressesProvider` that can call this function is `setAddress` and this function is governed by the Aave Governance. Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the Aave Governance V3 Guardian to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

This action is more comprehensive than freezing or pausing, as it completely deactivates the reserve, preventing any further user interactions with the asset within the pool. Dropping the reserve requires that the aToken and the DebtToken supplies are 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PoolConfigurator (Proxy)                                                                                                                                                     |

It achieves this by pointing to a new smart contract that implements the interest rate strategy. The `PoolConfigurator` is the only permissioned account to call this function.

This function is integral to Aave's cross-chain liquidity feature known as "Portals", which facilitates seamless asset transfers across different blockchain networks for users. Users can have the funds on the destination chain with the transanction mined. Upon arrival of the underlying assets on the target network by the bridge, the bridge contract invokes the `backUnbacked` function and pays a fee to Aave V3 Portal system. This function supplies the underlying assets to the Aave protocol, thereby backing the previously minted aTokens and ensuring the system's solvency.                                                                                                                                                                | no permission holder (ie un-used)                                                                                                                                            |

Like it is done by `PoolAddressesProviderRegistry` which keeps track of different `PoolAddressesProvider`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |
| PoolAddressesProvider                                               | setAddress                             | Sets a new address in the `PoolAddressesProvider` for one of the following contracts `Pool`, `PoolConfigurator`, `PriceOracle`, `ACLManager`, `Executor` and `PriceOracleSentinel`. `PoolAddressesProvider` is the main registry of addresses part of or connected to the a specific market. Permission over this function is crucial as it allows to set relationships between contracts. Setting a new `PoolConfigurator` or `ACLManager` would allow an attacker to change Reserve Parameters at will which would result in the loss of funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

This allows to control on the `EmissionManager` the access to this function, by allowing accounts to manage emissions for certain assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | EmissionManager                                                                                                                                                              |

The StataTokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StaticAToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StaticAToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StaticAToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets (aToken) and their corresponding StaticAToken addresses. StaticAToken are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism.

The `Pool` contract calls the price source that is set with this function to determine the value of collateral and borrowed assets. If no price feed was registered or the pricefeed is not functioning for a requested asset, the call will revert. This disables `withdraw` and `borrow` calls on the `Pool` contract. The `Pool` or certain reserves in the `Pool` would then need to be paused to replace the oracle. Malicious price sources could be listed here but the DAO governance is in control of listing.                                                                                           | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

The grace period determines the duration after a detected sequencer downtime in which liquidatable positions are protected. There are no limits enforced. A `RISK_ADMIN` role owner could set the grace period to 0, if a sequencer down time is detected force the transaction right at the beginning of the down time and make use of unfair liquidations. Currently no `RISK_ADMIN` role owner possesses functions to call `setGracePeriod`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `RISK_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                                 |

This function enforces boundaries to increase/decrease the cap only after 3 days at least have passed since the last cap update on a specific asset. This function calls `updateCaps` on `AaveV3ConfigEngine` which in turn calls `executeCapsUpdate` on `CapsEngine` which calls `setSupplyCap` and `setBorrowCap` on contract `PoolConfigurator`. The `PoolConfigurator` contract will then call `setConfiguration` on the `Pool` contract and enforcing this new cap on supply and borrow calls. If the supply cap is lower than current supply, no future deposits can be made until the cap is increased or the total amount of deposits is lower as the cap (same goes for borrow).                                                                                                                                                                                    | `RISK_COUNCIL`                                                                                                                                                               |

The change is immediate but since the change is in low % digits the risk associated with it is deemed low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `RISK_COUNCIL`                                                                                                                                                               |

This report is concerned with Arbitrum (Layer 2). a.DI is a component in the Aave Protocol designed for cross-chain communication for DAO messages. It helps to minimise the risk of the underlying individual bridge providers and enabling Aave's governance decisions and protocol updates to propagate across different blockchain environments efficiently. Changing the Admin with the function `changeAdmin` gives a new address the power to specify the new implementation over cross-chain communication. False or hostile take over are fatal for the project's cross-chain dependencies as messages from and to Arbitrum could be compromised signalling wrong votes from Ethereum (Governance Chain). Currently the Aave V3 mainnet a.DI does not allow to receive messages from Arbitrum. | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                   |

The risk associated with this function is to deploy and upgrade to a new implementation that is compromised or less secure.

This method allows to update configuration for all chains that this CCC can receive from. Confirmations are part of the consensus mechanism of the a.DI system. As an example, if 2 out of 3 for Ethereum -> Polygon means that 2 out of the 3 bridges need to pass the desired bridged transaction from Ethereum to Polygon in order to be executed on the destination chain (Polygon).

| CrossChainControllerUpgradeRev3 (Implemenation)                     | disallowReceiverBridgeAdapters         | This method achieves to disallow receiving cross-chain messages from existing bridge adapters for all allowed chains or just a subset of chains. The bridge adapter then can no longer call `receiveCrossChainMessage` on this `CrossChainController` from the disallowed chain(s). There is no guardrail to prevent to remove all bridge adapters as allowed senders to this contract (receiving from them). This would lead to a situation where mainnet cannot receive any messages from other chains. Since a voting can be executed on mainnet governance is still functional and it can recover to send messages to other chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

| PayloadsController (Implementation)                                 | transferOwnership                      | The owner can call `updateExecutors`, `updateGuardian`, `emergencyTokenTransfer`, `emergencyEtherTransfer` and the two functions to transfer and revoke ownership. Calling this function results in transferring the owner to a new specified address. This ownership should only be in the control of the governance as it can appoint an address that can cancel accepted payloads, effectively blocking governance. If the governance lost ownership over this function it could update the contract to restore similar or the same logic with itself as owner over these functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

### Roles Permission inside `ACLManager`

ID refers to the 32-bytes value that is used within `AccessControl` by Open Zeppelin (inherited by `ACLManager`) to identify different roles.

RoleAdmin is currently the Governance Executor, but technically any address could become a role admin.
