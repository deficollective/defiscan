# Summary

Aave v3 Prime is a lending protocol which is governed by the Aave DAO with a specific focus on ETH, the Lido `stETH` token and restaking tokens. Users can lend and borrow assets previous mentioned assets.

Aave v3 Prime uses the same contract code as Aave v3 Core instance overall, but redeployed modules _Lend & Borrow_ and _Reserve Parameters_, while re-using the same deployments for _Treasury, Aave Ecosystem Reserves & Rewards_, the _GHO Stablecoin_ and the _Aave Governance_.

We only report on the specific differences in this report, to understand the redeployed and re-used modules check out our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

Due to the minimal differences to Aave v3 Core the same scores apply for Aave v3 Prime.

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Aave V3 Prime instance deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet achieves a _Low_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The permissions and _Upgradeability_ in the re-deployed contracts of the modules _Core Lend & Borrow_ and _Reserve Parameters_ are the same to the Aave v3 Core instance. The permission owners are the same multisig accounts as on the Aave v3 Core instance. As a consequence, the same _Upgradeability_ rating is assigned to the Aave v3 Prime report.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

The Aave v3 Prime instance uses the same dependencies as the Aave v3 Core instance plus an additional dependency which is the Risk Oracle.

### Risk Oracle

Next to handing some control over market parameters to the [Risk Council](#security-council) via steward contracts, the Aave V3 _Prime_ instance on Mainnet updates the interest rate by handing off the control to a Risk Oracle implemented by Chaos Labs (service provider to the DAO). The Risk Oracle by Chaos Labs receives a _High centralization_ rating but the `EdgeRiskSteward` makes sure the updated parameters by the `RiskOracle` contract are within guardrails to prevent abusive behavior. In case of failure of the Risk Oracle, the [Risk Council](#security-council) can still update the interest rate parameters in due time, so the Risk Oracle setup is fault tolerant. No additional dependency risk is introduced by using the Risk Oracle provided by Chaos Labs.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

The Aave v3 _Prime_, _Core_ and _Etherfi_ instances use the same governance structure, thus the same exit window risks apply.

Read more in our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

Aave V3 Prime is accessible through the same Aave UI and third party UIs than the Aave v3 Core instance.

Read more in our Aave v3 Core instance [report](/protocols/aave/ethereum).

> Accessibility score: Low

## Conclusion

The Aave-v3 Ethereum mainnet protocol, and specifically the Aave v3 Prime instance achieves _High_ centralization risk scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Autonomy_ and _Exit Window_ dimensions. It thus ranks **Stage 0**.

The protocol could reach **Stage 1** by; 1) adopting the security council requirements for the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig account and 2) implementing fallback mechanism around the Chainlink oracle (or Chainlink adopting a _Security Council_ setup for its own multisig account).

The project additionally could advance to **Stage 2** if all critical permissions were assigned to _Aave Governance_ and protected with a 30-day _Exit Window_.

# Protocol Analysis

## Upgradeable Pool Contract and mutable reserve parameters

Specifically to the Aave v3 Prime instance there is an additional Steward contract called `EdgeRiskSteward` which calls changes to the risk parameters. The new values for the parameters are pushed on-chain by the Risk Oracle by Chaos Labs.

![Reserve Parameter Control](../diagrams/Aave_V3_Prime_Reserve_Parameter_Control.png)

## Dependencies

### Risk Oracle

Besides the [Risk Council](#security-council) having control over market parameters via steward contracts, the Aave V3 instance on the Prime instance automates the borrow and supply cap automatically by handing off the updates of this caps to a risk oracle implemented by Chaos Labs (service provider to the DAO). This allows automatic updates of these risk parameters based on quantitative algorithmic risk models in real time. `EdgeRiskSteward` makes sure the values submitted by the `RiskOracle` contract are within guardrails to prevent abusive behavior by malicious intent.

See our report on [Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle](/protocols/chaos-labs-risk-oracle/ethereum)

# Governance

The The Aave v3 _Prime_, _Core_ and _Etherfi_ instances use the same governance structure, thus the same exit window risks apply.

Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the Aave Governance V3 Guardian to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

Permission over this function is crucial as it allows to set relationships between contracts. Setting a new `PoolConfigurator` or `ACLManager` would allow an attacker to change Reserve Parameters at will which would result in the loss of funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

This includes actions such as supplying assets, borrowing, repaying, withdrawing, and liquidations. When un-pausing a graceperiod can be specified which is the count of seconds after unpause during which liquidations will not be allowed. It is called either by the Payload of an approved Vote via L1 Executor or any address with the `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role. A malicious contract owning the `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role could pause - unpause - liquidate and thus be the sole liquidator as this is possible in a single transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` or `POOL_ADMIN` Role                                                                                                                                       |

| RewardsController (Proxy) (BaseImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy) | upgradeTo                              | This function allows the permission owner to set a new implementation contract to forward calls to. This can change the whole `RewardsController` implementation logic and thus can affect rewards from ongoing incentive campaigns. The function on `PoolAddressesProvider` that can call this function is `setAddress` and this function is governed by the Aave Governance. Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the Aave Governance V3 Guardian to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

The StaticATokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StaticAToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StaticAToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StaticAToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets (aToken) and their corresponding StaticAToken addresses. StaticAToken are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism. Updating the implementation contract changes the token factory's logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ProxyAdmin (0xD3cF979e676265e4f6379749DECe4708B9A22476)                                                                                                                      |

The `Pool` contract calls the price source that is set with this function to determine the value of collateral and borrowed assets. If no price feed was registered or the pricefeed is not functioning for a requested asset, the call will revert. This disables `withdraw` and `borrow` calls on the `Pool` contract. The `Pool` or certain reserves in the `Pool` would then need to be paused to replace the oracle. Malicious price sources could be listed here but the DAO governance is in control of listing.                                  | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

The fallback oracle is like `AaveOracle` a contract that aggregates multiple sources. Currently no fallback oracle is set on AaveV3 main market. It would allow to increase price certainty for a given asset irrespective of oracle failures. If operated it would trigger if prices reported by the primary oracle are below 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

This function enforces boundaries to increase/decrease the cap only after 3 days at least have passed since the last cap update on a specific asset. This function calls `updateCaps` on `AaveV3ConfigEngine` which in turn calls `executeCapsUpdate` on `CapsEngine` which calls `setSupplyCap` and `setBorrowCap` on contract `PoolConfigurator`. The `PoolConfigurator` contract will then call `setConfiguration` on the `Pool` contract and enforcing this new cap on supply and borrow calls. If the supply cap is lower than current supply, no future deposits can be made until the cap is increased or the total amount of deposits is lower as the cap (same goes for borrow).                                                                                                                           | `RISK_COUNCIL`                                                                                                                                                               |

The following parameters are subject to change with this function: `optimalUsageRatio` (Optimal Point), `baseVariableBorrowRate`, `variableRateSlope1` and `variableRateSlope2`. A rate update is only possible after minDelay has passed after last update. A rate increase / decrease is only allowed by a magnitude of maxPercentChange. `optimalUsageRatio` by 3%, `baseVariableBorrowRate` by 0.5%, `variableRateSlope1` by 0.5% and `variableRateSlope2` by 5%. This function calls via an intermediate contract `setReserveInterestRateData` on `PoolConfigurator` which in turn calls the `Pool` contract to `setConfiguration`.

### Roles Permission inside `ACLManager`

ID refers to the 32-bytes value that is used within `AccessControl` by Open Zeppelin (inherited by `ACLManager`) to identify different roles.

RoleAdmin is currently the Governance Executor, but technically any address could become a role admin.
