# Summary

Aave v3 is a lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow different ERC20 assets. Users are able to create positions that consist of debt in different loan assets which is secured by different collateral assets. The lending market allows anyone to liquidate insolvent positions, based on an external price feed and specific collateral factors representing an asset's specific risk profile. Furthermore, instead of borrowing supplied assets, Aave V3 also issues its own stablecoin, GHO. Users can borrow and lend GHO like any other asset in the system.

The Aave DAO is Aave's onchain governance system, allowing AAVE, stkAAVE and aAAVE holders to govern over various aspects ranging across treasury management, risk management and strategic initiatives.

Different Aave protocol _Instances_ exist and are managed by the Aave DAO. These instances focus on specific use cases and chains. This review covers the Ethereum Mainnet Core instance.

# Ratings

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Aave V3 _Core_ instance deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet achieves a _Low_ centralization risk score.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The Aave v3 protocol can be analyzed in a number of logical modules: _Core Lend & Borrow_, _Reserve Parameters_, _Treasury, Aave Ecosystem Reserves & Rewards_, _GHO Stablecoin_ and _Aave Governance_. Each module exposes various degrees of control as explained in more detail below. Overall, these control vectors could result in the loss of user funds, loss of unclaimed yield or otherwise materially affect the expected performance of the protocol. All the control vectors, apart from the [Emergency Admin](#security-council)'s priviledge, are behind governance vote or if permissions are given to a multisig account, the permission is successfully restricted to prevent mis-use by using steward contracts.
If the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) adhered to the [security council standards](/learn-more#security-council-requirements), the _Upgradeability Risk_ would achieve a _medium_ score. With the current setup the Aave V3 _core instance_ achieves a _High_ upgradeability score.

### Core Lending & Borrowing

This module forms the core of Aave v3's borrow & lending features and keeps track of users' positions and related protocol state. It centers around the `Pool` contract that governs how debt in the system can be built up, collateralized and how positions can be liquidated. It includes Aave v3's `aTokens` and `variableDebtTokens`. All of these contracts are fully upgradeable through the _Aave Governance_ [module](#aave-governance). An unintended (or malicious) contract upgrade can result in the loss of user funds, loss of unclaimed yield or otherwise materially affect the expected protocol performance.

Special attention is required for the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig, which owns the role `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` that allows to pause a single reserve or pause the entire core market instance (all reserves / the entire Pool). The [Emergency Admin](#security-council) can also disable the grace period for liquidations after discontinuing the pause and resume market activities. The actions by the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) are reversible, but require a governance vote. The [Emergency Admin](#security-council) does not adhere to the _security council requirements_, as the members of the multisig are considered _insiders_ of the Aave DAO (service providers and key voting power holders). In case of a market down turn the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) could mis-use the power to liquidate from a priviledged position. Quoting the [Aave V3 technical paper](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/docs/Aave_V3_Technical_Paper.pdf) page 16.

> Timed with a market crash, the attacker can turn the pool off, and then atomically perform the sequence (turn-on - liquidate - turn-off), allowing him to be the sole liquidator.

### Reserve Parameters

The _Reserve Parameters_ module is responsible for maintaining and updating critical risk parameters in the Aave v3 protocol. Among others, these include the set of enabled collateral and loan assets, their specific _liquidation loan-to-value_ ratios, _liquidation bonuses_ or _interest rate parameters_ and _borrow and supply caps_. An upgradeable `PoolConfigurator` contract controls these parameters with permissions to implement changes delegated to different, specialized, multisig accounts such as the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) or [Risk Council](#security-council). A system of _Roles_, implemented using OpenZeppelin's ACL pattern, and _Stewards_ ensures that these multisig accounts can only implement changes in a limited range or with a certain frequency. This system thus limits the risk of unintended updates through the multisig accounts. However, an upgrade of the `PoolConfigurator` contract could remove these safeguards, for instance by assigning permissions to an _EOA_ or multisig account directly, thus reintroducing the risk of loss of funds, loss of unclaimed yield or a material change of the expected protocol performance.

### Treasury, Aave Ecosystem Reserves and Rewards System

This module manages how fees are collected, spent and third-party rewards allocated and claimed by users. Fees taken across the Aave v3 protocol (and previous versions) are collected in the `TreasuryCollector`, a fully upgradeable contract. Through _Aave Governance_ and different (upgradeable) utility contracts these funds are distributed among _service providers_ and ecosystem initiatives.

### GHO Stablecoin

GHO is Aave v3's native stablecoin that is pegged to the US Dollar and mintable at a 1:1 rate against the centralized USDC and USDT stablecoins through the `GhoStabilityModule` contract. Furthermore, a [Risk Council](#security-council) multisig account (not a _Security Council_ according to the DeFiScan definition) has the ability to mint unbacked GHO supply into (or burn from) the Aave lending market for users to borrow by supplying collateral assets (and thus collateralizing the GHO supply) (this [Risk Council](#security-council) is not the same multisig as the multisig controlling the steward contracts for reserve parameters.) Direct minting and burning through the [Risk Council](#security-council) is managed through the `GhoDirectMinter` contract and limited by minting caps which are controlled by the _Aave Governance_. Both the `GhoStabilityModule` and the `GhoDirectMinter` as well as the respective `aToken` and `variableDebtToken` contracts are upgradeable by the _Aave Governance_ opening the possibility of uncontrolled minting or burning of GHO in case of an unintended upgrade. If abused, this control thus introduces a risk of loss of funds, loss of unclaimed yield (accrued interest in GHO) or an otherwise material impact on the expected protocol performance for GHO holders and Aave users.

### Aave Governance

_Aave Governance_ refers to Aave v3's onchain governance system which controls contract upgrades as well as other critical permissions as outlined above. We discuss the governance process itself in the _Exit Window_ [section](#exit-window) and here focus on upgradeability and control in this module itself. This governance process is implemented in the `GovernanceV3` contract which is fully upgradeable through a permissionless governance proposal. Hence, an unintended proposal could change the _Aave Governance_ system and reassign its control to a less robust or fully centralized setup. In order to mitigate this risk, upgrades to the `GovernanceV3` contract, as well as the AAVE token, require passing a 7 day _Exit Window_ (read more [here](#exit-window)). During this window, users can exit the Aave v3 protocol. Furthermore, the [Aave Governance v3 Guardian](#security-council) multisig account, adhering to the _Security Council_ requirements, can cancel the execution of unintended proposals. On the other hand, this control can be abused to censor regular proposals with majority support.

Also note that the (current) implementation of `GovernanceV3` enables a native multi-chain governance process. Specifically, this process enables proposals to designate a different chain for holding governance votes. While Aave v3's proprietary cross-chain messaging protocol, called `a.DI`, itself does not exhibit centralized control, it makes the governance process susceptible to control over the designated chain itself.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

### Oracle and Prices

The Aave V3 protocol relies on Chainlink oracle feeds to price collateral and borrowed assets in the system.

Chainlink achieves a _High_ centralization risk score as discussed in a separate report [here](/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum).

The protocol does currently have limited validation on asset prices provided by Chainlink. These checks include upper caps for stablecoins and LSTs and a sanity check that the price is above 0 for all assets. If the reported price by the price feed was below 0, a fallback oracle would be queried.

Aave has currently no fallback oracle price feeds instantiated. As a consequence if the price was equal to or below 0, user actions on the `Pool` contract that require a price would revert.

The replacement of a stale or untrusted oracle price feed requires a governance vote on permission level 1 (see [Exit Window](#exit-window)).

### Cross-Chain Vote

Votes are currently held on Polygon by using a system called a.DI for cross-chain communication developed by the Aave Community (BGD Labs).

The a.DI does not rely on a single bridge provider to move messages across different networks, but uses a 2/3 threshold, sending the messages in parallel via different bridge providers, reducing the dependency on a single provider.

If the community cannot or does not want to use the a.DI or the other voting networks, then the community still can carry out the vote on Ethereum Mainnet. This would eliminate the cross-chain dependencies for voting.

The cross-chain voting system has low centralization risk because of its fault tolerant design, while the oracle system is currently unmitigated.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Critical permissions, including protocol upgrades, are controlled by _Aave Governance_ and an [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig account.

Two levels of permissions are separated in the (current) implementation of _Aave Governance_: _Level 2_ defines permissions on the governance system itself and on the `AAVE` token contract, _Level 1_ covers the remaining permissions.

AAVE holders (also stkAAVE, aAAVE) are able to create new proposals (requires 80,000 / 200,0000 votes for Level 1 / Level 2) and vote on proposals (at least 320,000 / 1,040,000 votes are required for a valid proposal and a voting differential (yes minus no votes) of 80,000 / 1,040,000 votes).

Votes start 1 day after proposal creation and the voting period is 10 days for _Level 2_, and 3 days for _Level 1_ proposals.

The execution of successful votes is blocked by an Exit Window with a delay of 7 days for _Level 2_ and 1 day for _Level 1_ permissions. While these Exit Windows do not qualify for a _Low_ or _Medium_ score, the risk of unwanted updates is further mitigated by the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council) multisig, which is able to cancel unintended governance proposals and which adheres to the _Security Council_ requirements.

However, these safeguards do only apply to permissions controlled by _Aave Governance_. The [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig too holds critical permissions which are not protected with an Exit Window or _Security Council_ setup. Specifically, the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) is able to pause individual Aave markets or the entire protocol as well as disabling the liquidation grace period. If compromised e.g. during a high-volatility market, these permissions could be taken advantage of, in order to execute controlled liquidations.

Meanwhile the permissions of multisig accounts [Risk Council](#security-council) for `Gho` and for the `Pool` contract are sufficiently restricted by steward contracts in terms of frequency of updates and magnitude of the updates, such that an exit window is not required.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The official frontend to the Aave V3 protocol is open source and each commit on Aave's GitHub repository is published to IPFS (https://github.com/aave/interface/releases).

In addition to that the Aave v3 protocol is also available through [DeFi Saver](https://app.defisaver.com/aave) and other third-party tools.

https://aave.com/help/aave-101/accessing-aave

> Accessibility score: Low

## Conclusion

The Aave-v3 Ethereum mainnet protocol achieves High centralization risk scores for its Upgradeability, Autonomy and Exit Window dimensions. It thus ranks **Stage 0**.

The protocol could reach **Stage 1** by; 1) adopting the security council requirements for the [Emergency Admin](#security-council) multisig account and 2) implementing fallback mechanism around the Chainlink oracle (or Chainlink adopting a _Security Council_ setup for its own multisig account).

The project additionally could advance to **Stage 2** if all critical permissions were assigned to Aave Governance and protected with a 30-day _Exit Window_.

> Overall Score: Stage 0

# Reviewer Notes

⚠️ During our analysis, we identified a unverified role (not mentioned in the docs https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-permissions-book/blob/main/out/MAINNET-V3.md#admins). Role Id is `0xd1d2cf869016112a9af1107bcf43c3759daf22cf734aad47d0c9c726e33bc782`. The owners of this role are related to the V2 to V3 migration.

⚠️ Third parties are able to distribute rewards, in their own ERC20 token, to Aave users through the `RewardsControllerManager` and `EmissionManager` contracts. Rewards are distributed continuously among eligible users but controlled by the [Aave Chan Initiative multisig](#security-council) account until claimed. The Aave Chan Initiative multisig account can thus potentially be abused to withhold or steal distributed rewards resulting in a loss of unclaimed yield for users.

# Protocol Analysis

## Upgradeable Pool Contract and mutable reserve parameters

The center of the Aave V3 market is the contract called `Pool`. Each supported asset is attached to a reserve in this `Pool` contract. A reserve specifies the market parameters for this asset (Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, Supply and Borrow Caps and the interest rate model). Additionally, each asset (ie reserve) can be enabled or disabled for borrowing, if disabled, the asset can only be supplied as collateral for borrowing other assets. The assets are technically deposited to the respective aToken contracts (the receipt token of supplied assets) of a given reserve.

![Market](../diagrams/Aave_V3_Market.png)

The `Pool` contract is completely upgradeable via the proxy-pattern. The permission to update the `Pool` contract via the proxy contract is owned by the onchain governance (DAO).

![Reserve Parameter Control](../diagrams/Aave_V3_Reserve_Parameter_Control.png)

In addition to completely upgrading the contracts, the control over some market parameters is handed to the [Risk Council](#security-council) multisig through steward contracts. Steward contracts are contracts that wrap around permissions and restrict the multisig's permission to update market parameters with guardrails. These guardrails include rate-limiting (frequency) as well as relative or absolute changes to parameters. The market parameters which are assigned to the [Risk Council](#security-council) via the steward contracts do not include binary decisions like listing an asset, or allowing/disallowing an asset as collateral. Governance is always the only owner of these steward contracts and is the only allowed entity to update the guardrails.

The system with risk intermediaries (Stewards & Councils) was implemented by giving the `PoolConfigurator` contract permission to change any reserve parameter on the `Pool` contract while the `PoolConfigurator` assigns various roles from the `ACLManager` to these permissioned funcions. LTV, LLTV or Supply and Borrow Caps are assigned to the `RISK_ADMIN` role. Steward contracts own these roles and expose the functions with aforementioned guardrails. Councils (regular multisigs) are the permission owners of these steward functions and thus have only limited control over reserve parameters which prevents malicious behavior and reduces trust assumptions for these multisigs.

This system allows to add more risk councils and to deploy more steward contracts if needed.

The Governance itself can also update reserve parameters directly if the community decides to do so. Additionally Governance has direct permissions on the `PoolConfigurator` endpoints via the role called `POOL_ADMIN` to make changes to the parameters without the Stewards and Councils as intermediaries.

## Smart Contract Upgrade Flow

Many contracts of the Aave V3 system are directly upgradeable through a proxy pattern (see in the contract table for proxy keyword). The `Executor` contract would call the `upgradeTo` and point to the referenced new implementation contract that is specified in the payload. Additionally to the proxy upgrade pattern, Aave V3 has a contract called `PoolAddressesProvider` which serves as a registry of contracts. Through this contract upgrades can be made by deploying a new contract and switching the reference inside the `PoolAddressesProvider` as contracts in the Aave V3 system rely on `PoolAddressesProvider` as a registry of Aave V3 contracts. Also the `PoolAddressesProvider` is owner of many crucial contracts as well.

Contracts that `PoolAddressesProvider` owns or can set are

- `Pool`
- `PoolConfigurator`
- `ACLManager`
- `Governance Executor`

## Treasury

Treasury is funded through reserve fees collected when users pay back debt. The treasury contract is called `Collector`. The treasury contract allows the Aave DAO to pay service providers and fund incentives to grow the Aave ecosystem.

The DAO community can vote on proposals that call `createStream` or `transfer` on the `Collector` contract to spend tokens on behalf of the DAO.

Additionally, the DAO owns permissions to create streams and initiate transfers from the Ecosystem Reserve which holds Aave tokens. The DAO executes via a controller contract called `AaveEcosystemReserveController`.

Both the treasury and the Aave reserve are upgradeable contracts which are sensitive to update, as they hold a lot of value.

## Incentives

3rd parties can list incentives additional to the interest rate paid to the suppliers of capital via the `EmissionManager`. The governance admits the emission admin role to an onchain account that can configure the details of a specific incentive (token, amount of tokens, duration). The tokens are claimed from an account external of the Aave V3 system (for example the ACI multisig) via the `RewardsController` contract.
As a consequence the trust assumptions on receiving the additional incentives has to be studied on a case-by-case basis.

![Treasury](../diagrams/Aave_V3_Treasury.png)

## GHO

GHO is the native stablecoin of Aave. The actual total supply of GHO is governed by the facilitators, which are a set of contracts that have permission to call mint on the `GHO` contract. The total minted GHO cannot exceed an amount set by the DAO. This is enforced by a limit on each facilitator (bucket cap).

Currently the facilitators are

- GhoAToken (Aave market)
- GhoDirectMinter
- GHOFlashMinter
- GHO Stability Modules (USDC, USDT)

Via the `GSM` GHO is redeemable for USDC and USDT at a 1:1 rate up to a certain USDC and USDT cap. The GHO dedicated multisig [Risk Council](#security-council) can update the exposure caps to USDC/USDT via the `GhoGsmSteward`. Upon receiving USDC/USDT `GSM` supplies the stablecoins to the Aave USDC and USDT reserve and issues freshly minted GHO to the seller of the stablecoins. Similarly if the user buys USDC or USDT from the GSM, the returned GHO is burned.

GHO can be borrowed from the reserve at a dynamic interest rate. The total borrowed GHO cannot exceed the bucket cap. Governance and the [Risk Council](#security-council) manage the interest rate by supplying fresh GHO to the reserve via the `GhoDirectMinter` or they can withdraw and burn GHO from the reserve increasing the interest rate.

![Gho](../diagrams/Aave_V3_GHO.png)

# Dependencies

## a.DI

The Aave delivery infrastructure (a.DI) ensures decentralized and fault-tolerant cross-chain messaging. It achieves this by encoding a message and submitting it to multiple independent bridges.

On the receiving end (destination network) the a.DI validates the transaction, requiring multiple matching messages from different bridges before executing the bridged message on the destination network. If the confirmation threshold is not reached, a new attempt can be made by retrying the cross-chain message which uses the same bridge configuration but attempts with a new message. In case the previous transaction failed because lack of gas or other reasons.

The a.DI also incorporates an emergency mode which allows the [Aave Governance V3 guardian](#security-council) to replace current bridge providers if one or more bridges become untrusted.

## Oracle

Aave stores the oracle price feeds in the `AaveOracle` contract. The price feeds can be one of 3 kind,

1. regular un-mitigated Chainlink price feed (for all volatile assets)
2. a `PriceCapAdapterStable` contract which wraps the regular Chainlink price feed and adds an upper cap to the reported stablecoin price, if the price is above the cap, the cap is returned, otherwise the price is returned
3. a price cap adapter for LSTs which checks the price ratio of the asset/underlying and compares it to an upper cap computed by the maximum allowed growth rate and the duration since the last check

The Chainlink oracle system itself is upgradeable potentially as discussed in a separate report [here](/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum).

# Governance

The onchain governance system of Aave is multi-chain by design. The creation of proposals and voting on the proposals in permissionless. In this paragraph, the architecture and existing permissions are highlighted.

To get to the stage of voting and creating an onchain proposal a few prior steps need to be passed to have sufficient probability of being accepted through an onchain vote.

1. The proposal was discussed with the community and incorporated feedback
2. A temperature check on Snapshot is conducted. This vote is not binding, but it helps determining if sufficient support is within the community to move the proposal forward.
3. ARFC (Aave Request for Final Comments) where service provider and community members prepare the AIP
4. AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) which includes the contract payload submission onchain
5. Actual onchain vote
6. Execution on the `PayloadsController` on each chain where the change needs to be enforced

## AIP - Payload submission

Payload submission is technically permissionless. The payload is created by calling `createPayload` on the `PayloadsController` contract. The payload is an array of actions and each action contains information that specifies which contract to call with what data.

## Voting

Voting can be held on either Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon (PoS) or Avalanche. When proposal is created (`createProposal`) the specified `VotingPortal` address determines the voting network of the particular vote. Once the voting is activated by the community, the details of the vote (proposal id, snapshot and voting duration) are sent to the voting network cross-chain with the general purpose Aave delivery infrastructure (a.DI). Mainnet AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE token holders can vote on the voting network (e.g Polygon PoS) via the `VotingMachine` contract. The `VotingMachine` contract uses state tree hashes to validate the voting power of each voter. Once the voting duration is over, users can call `closeAndSendVote` which sends the results back to mainnet.

## Execution

Once the proposal passes, the function `executeProposal` on the `AaveGovernanceV3` allows to execute the approved proposal, which forwards the message to the `CrossChainController` (calling `forward`). The CCC forwards the proposal to each chain where the proposal must be executed. If the proposal is also dedicated to the deployment on Ethereum, the payload id is forwarded to the `SameChainAdapter` that calls the function `receiveCrossChainMessage` on the `PayloadsController` contract, which queues the payload to be executed. The payload was previously created on the `PayloadsController` by calling `createPayload` which returns a payload id. This payload id is referenced in the governance proposal (see previous section). Anyone can call `executePayload` once sufficient time has passed (timelock). By calling `executePayload` on the `PayloadsController` `executeTransaction` on the `Executor Lvl1` contract will be triggered. A technical detail, if in this report it is mentioned that the governance owns the permission, it is actually (if we are very precise) this `Executor Lvl1` contract (as shown in the permission table) because community approved payloads will be executed from this contract. Alternatively also the `Executor Lvl2` can be the chosen executor by the payload if it requires permission to update the AAVE token or the Aave governance contract.

In case of a malicious proposal the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council) can step in and stop the malicious proposal of being executed at the level of the `Payloads Controller` or at the Governance contract level (`AaveGovernanceV3`). Note this is can happen even if the proposal is supported by the majority of the community.

Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council) to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

This can be used to create an onchain registry of PoolAddressesProviders to identify and validate multiple Aave markets. Like it is done by `PoolAddressesProviderRegistry` which keeps track of different `PoolAddressesProvider`. Currently on Ethereum Mainnet there are three markets main market, lido market and etherfi market. They all got their own `PoolAddressesProvider` instance, and also their own `Pool`, `PoolConfigurator` and `ACLManager` and a bunch of other contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

Permission over this function is crucial as it allows to set relationships between contracts. Setting a new `PoolConfigurator` or `ACLManager` would allow an attacker to change Reserve Parameters at will which would result in the loss of funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

This includes actions such as supplying assets, borrowing, repaying, withdrawing, and liquidations. When un-pausing a graceperiod can be specified which is the count of seconds after unpause during which liquidations will not be allowed. It is called either by the Payload of an approved Vote via L1 Executor or any address with the `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role. A malicious contract owning the `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role could pause - unpause - liquidate and thus be the sole liquidator as this is possible in a single transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` or `POOL_ADMIN` Role                                                                                                                                       |

Other roles can also lead to undesired and harmful actions, but are less privileged on the `PoolConfigurator` contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `DEFAULT_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                                              |

After a slashing event, the exchange rate is updated to reflect the reduced total assets, proportionally affecting all stakers. The module then enters a post-slashing period during which new staking is temporarily disabled to prevent dilution of existing stakers' shares. Stakers can redeem their tokens without waiting for a cooldown period, allowing them to exit the module promptly. No further slashing events can occur until the current one is settled.

Facilitators are approved by the `FACILITATOR_MANAGER_ROLE` owner. Currently GHO can be created in 4 ways. In a flash loan facilitated by `GHOFlashMinter`, GHO tokens can be borrowed (collateralised borrow position), the GHO Stability Modules which allow to trade 1 GHO against 1 USDC or USDT at a fixed rate and the `GhoDirectMinter` which allows the governance to mint and supply GHO in to the Aave Market. The privilege to mint GHO must be sufficiently protected to prevent loss of funds via dilution. The governance has control over all listed facilitators via this contract `Executor_lvl1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | GhoAToken, GHOFlashMinter, GSMUSDC, GSMUSDT, GhoDirectMinter                                                                                                                 |

A malicious admin could use the upgrade to steal the funds from the protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ProxyAdmin (0xD3cF979e676265e4f6379749DECe4708B9A22476)                                                                                                                      |

This pattern also allows registering new roles by calling this function with a new identifier. The admin of these roles is the `DEFAULT_ADMIN` role. The remaining roles can call the permissioned functions on this contract. The permissions can be revoked by calling `revokeRole` or updating this implementation contract, where the roles do not own any permissions anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `DEFAULT_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                                              |

After a slashing event, the exchange rate is updated to reflect the reduced total assets, proportionally affecting all stakers. The module then enters a post-slashing period during which new staking is temporarily disabled to prevent dilution of existing stakers' shares. Stakers can redeem their tokens without waiting for a cooldown period, allowing them to exit the module promptly. No further slashing events can occur until the current one is settled. The claimed funds from slashing is used to cover shortfalls of the protocol. To resume the staking contract (allow new deposits and new slashing events) the function `settleSlashing` needs to be called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `SLASH_ADMIN_ROLE`                                                                                                                                                           |

After a slashing event, the exchange rate is updated to reflect the reduced total assets, proportionally affecting all stakers. The module then enters a post-slashing period during which new staking is temporarily disabled to prevent dilution of existing stakers' shares. Stakers can redeem their tokens without waiting for a cooldown period, allowing them to exit the module promptly. No further slashing events can occur until the current one is settled. The claimed funds from slashing is used to cover shortfalls of the protocol. To resume the staking contract (allow new deposits and new slashing events) the function `settleSlashing` needs to be called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `SLASH_ADMIN_ROLE`                                                                                                                                                           |

| RewardsController (Proxy) (BaseImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy) | upgradeTo                              | This function allows the permission owner to set a new implementation contract to forward calls to. This can change the whole `RewardsController` implementation logic and thus can affect rewards from ongoing incentive campaigns. The function on `PoolAddressesProvider` that can call this function is `setAddress` and this function is governed by the Aave Governance. Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council) to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

The StaticATokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StaticAToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StaticAToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StaticAToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets (aToken) and their corresponding StaticAToken addresses. StaticAToken are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism. Updating the implementation contract changes the token factory's logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ProxyAdmin (0xD3cF979e676265e4f6379749DECe4708B9A22476)                                                                                                                      |

The `Pool` contract calls the price source that is set with this function to determine the value of collateral and borrowed assets. If no price feed was registered or the pricefeed is not functioning for a requested asset, the call will revert. This disables `withdraw` and `borrow` calls on the `Pool` contract. The `Pool` or certain reserves in the `Pool` would then need to be paused to replace the oracle. Malicious price sources could be listed here but the DAO governance is in control of listing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

The fallback oracle is like `AaveOracle` a contract that aggregates multiple sources. Currently no fallback oracle is set on AaveV3 main market. It would allow to increase price certainty for a given asset irrespective of oracle failures. If operated it would trigger if prices reported by the primary oracle are below 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

Malicious ownership will lead to loss of user funds and DAO treasury funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PayloadsController (Proxy)                                                                                                                                                   |

Disconnects governance decisions from the Aave V3 system. Only contract upgrades via `Executor_lvl2` (long executor) are still possible (Aave token contract and Governance contract). Risk Councils can still manage risk parameters of Aave V3 market. Funds in the Safety Module cannot be used for covering bad debt. Risk Council for `GhoGsmSteward` can still mint new GHO and supply it to the Aave V3 market. DAO treasury funds in `TreasuryCollector` and `AaveEcosystemReserve` are stuck indefinitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PayloadsController (Proxy)                                                                                                                                                   |

This function enforces boundaries to increase/decrease the cap only after 3 days at least have passed since the last cap update on a specific asset. This function calls `updateCaps` on `AaveV3ConfigEngine` which in turn calls `executeCapsUpdate` on `CapsEngine` which calls `setSupplyCap` and `setBorrowCap` on contract `PoolConfigurator`. The `PoolConfigurator` contract will then call `setConfiguration` on the `Pool` contract and enforcing this new cap on supply and borrow calls. If the supply cap is lower than current supply, no future deposits can be made until the cap is increased or the total amount of deposits is lower as the cap (same goes for borrow).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Risk Council (for Pool Stewards)                                                                                                                                             |

This call gets forwarded to the `CrossChainController` to change the cross-chain settings to fix the emergency. This can include disallow or allow bridges to receive or send to, and to list or delist originators of cross-chain messages. After this call, the emergency status is over, and the system is normally operating.

This report is concerned with Ethereum Mainnet, thus this contract represents a.DI on Ethereum. a.DI is a component in the Aave Protocol designed for cross-chain communication for DAO messages. It helps to minimise the risk of the underlying individual bridge providers and enabling Aave's governance decisions and protocol updates to propagate across different blockchain environments efficiently. Changing the Admin with the function `changeAdmin` gives a new address the power to specify the new implementation over cross-chain communication. False or hostile take over are fatal for the project's cross-chain dependencies as messages from and to Ethereum could be compromised signalling wrong votes to Ethereum or signalling false function calls to destination chains.                                                                                                                                                                                         | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                   |

| CrossChainControllerUpgradeRev3 (Implemenation)                   | disallowReceiverBridgeAdapters         | This method achieves to disallow receiving cross-chain messages from existing bridge adapters for all allowed chains or just a subset of chains. The bridge adapter then can no longer call `receiveCrossChainMessage` on this `CrossChainController` from the disallowed chain(s). There is no guardrail to prevent to remove all bridge adapters as allowed senders to this contract (receiving from them). This would lead to a situation where mainnet cannot receive any messages from other chains. Since a voting can be executed on mainnet governance is still functional and it can recover to send messages to other chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

There is no guardrail to prevent removing all senders. If a governance proposal that removes all senders is accepted and enforced, not cancelled by the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council), then Governance is incapable of holding any further vote after this, as it requires the CCC to forward messages (`activateVoting` on the Governance contract calls `VotingPortal` which calls the CCC with `forwardMessage` which requires sender permission. Also the `VotingMachine` on Ethereum mainnet sends the voting results to the CCC and requires to be approved as a sender). If the system is in emergency mode at the same time, the [Aave Governance V3 Guardian](#security-council) can fix the CCC by calling `solveEmergency` which allows to approve senders. However, if the system is not in emergency, the emergency status can also not be emitted, as it relies on the CCC for queueing the payload to call the function to transition to emergency state. As a result Governance is doomed. | Executor_lvl1                                                                                                                                                                |

These contracts enable proposals initiated on Ethereum to be voted on across different networks. They forward the voting details alongside the correct parameters for the a.DI system. There is one designated `VotingPortal` contract for each voting network. They are not upgradeable and need to be re-deployed if changes to the governance system need to be made. This `VotingPortal` in particular is for the case that the vote is held on mainnet itself.

### Roles Permission inside `ACLManager`

ID refers to the 32-bytes value that is used within `AccessControl` by Open Zeppelin (inherited by `ACLManager`) to identify different roles.

RoleAdmin is currently the Governance Executor, but technically any address could become a role admin.
