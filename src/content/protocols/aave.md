This function is integral to Aave's cross-chain liquidity feature known as "Portals," which facilitates seamless asset transfers across different blockchain networks.

This function supplies the underlying assets to the Aave protocol, thereby backing the previously minted aTokens and ensuring the system's solvency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | no permission holder (ie un-used)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The StataTokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StataToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StataToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StataToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets and their corresponding StataToken addresses. StataTokens are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism. Updating the implementation contract changes the TokenFactory's logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ProxyAdmin (0xD3cF979e676265e4f6379749DECe4708B9A22476)                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This function enforces boundaries to increase/decrease the cap only after 3 days at least have passed since the last cap update on a specific asset. This function calls `updateCaps` on `AaveV3ConfigEngine` which in turn calls `executeCapsUpdate` on `CapsEngine` which calls `setSupplyCap` and `setBorrowCap` on contract `PoolConfigurator`. The `PoolConfigurator` contract will then call `setConfiguration` on the `Pool` contract and enforcing this new cap on supply and borrow calls. If the supply cap is lower than current supply, no future deposits can be made until the cap is increased or the total amount of deposits is lower as the cap (same goes for borrow).                                                                                                                                                                               | RISK_COUNCIL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The following parameters are subject to change with this function: `optimalUsageRatio` (Optimal Point), `baseVariableBorrowRate`, `variableRateSlope1` and `variableRateSlope2`. A rate update is only possible after minDelay has passed after last update. A rate increase / decrease is only allowed by a magnitude of maxPercentChange. `optimalUsageRatio` by 3%, `baseVariableBorrowRate` by 0.5%, `variableRateSlope1` by 0.5% and `variableRateSlope2` by 5%.

This report is concerned with Ethereum Mainnet, thus this contract represents a.DI on Ethereum. a.DI is a component in the Aave Protocol designed for cross-chain communication for DAO messages. It helps to minimise the risk of the underlying individual bridge providers and enabling Aave's governance decisions and protocol updates to propagate across different blockchain environments efficiently. Changing the Admin with the function `changeAdmin` gives a new address the power to specify the new implementation over cross-chain communication. False or hostile take over are fatal for the project's cross-chain dependencies as messages from and to Ethereum could be compromised signalling wrong votes to Ethereum or signalling false function calls to destination chains. | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

At time of this writing CrossChainControllerUpgradeRev3 is the current version. The risk associated with this function is to deploy and upgrade to a new implementation that is compromised or less secure. If a vulnerability is introduced, cross-chain messages from and to Ethereum could signal wrong votes and decisions of the DAO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

By calling renounceOwnership the CrossChainController has no owner anymore. The previously mentioned functions are not callable anymore. As a result important parameters of CrossChainReceiver and CrossChainForwarder (send messages to other chains) cannot be changed anymore. While it mostly would affect efficiency, disabling or disallowing hacked bridges would not be possible, but since the system already abstracts single bridges to a consensus based abstracted cross-chain platform, single failures do not have a immediate effect.                                     | ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
