# Summary

Aave V3 allows users to lend and borrow Erc20 tokens and earn yield for lending.

On Ethereum Mainnet 3 markets exist mainnet, Lido and EtherFi. Markets Lido and EtherFi exist to allow efficient parameters for borrow and lending while containerize the risk associated with leveraged staked ETH. This report focuses on the Mainnet market (V3).

# Overview

## Chain

The report is concerned with the Aave V3 deployment on Ethereum mainnet.

> Chain score: high

## Upgradeability

Aave V3 allows for the upgrade of contracts. Those upgrades can change the logic and implementation of the markets, the reserves, the governance and the smart contract infrastructure around them. The upgrades could potentially result in the loss of funds or the loss of unclaimed yield of users. To enforce only positive and non-harmful upgrades of the contracts an on-chain governance (DAO) is set in place that reflects the intentions of the Aave Community.

In case of a malicious governance hijack by claiming enough voting power to pass a vote, the `Aave V3 Governance Guardian` can step in and veto the passed vote from being enforced.

Aave V3 also allows for changes of market parameters to manage the market and liquidity risk that come with offering borrow-lending operations to users. The updates to this parameters are ultimately executed via the `Risk Council`, but the Risk Council interacts via a layered system of contracts which restricts the permissions with guardrails, such that changes are extremely unlikely to lead to loss of funds or yield.

> Upgradeability score: high

## Autonomy

### Oracle and Prices

The Aave V3 protocol relies on Chainlink oracle feeds to price collateral and borrowed assets in the system. The protocol does not validate asset prices (apart from checking that they are above 0) returned by Chainlink. Aave V3 has the possibility to install a fallback oracle mechanism but is currently not-used or instantiated. The replacement of a stale or untrusted oracle feed requires a Aave V3 governance vote with a delay (see Exit Window).

The Chainlink oracle system itself is upgradeable without decentralized ownership over those permissions. This dependency thus introduces centralization risk in the Aave V3 protocol.

### Bridging and Votes

Bridging voting power

> Upgradeability score: high

## Exit Window

The suggested changes of a proposal are enforced after a timelock delay of either one day or 7 days.

> Exit Window score: low

## Accessibility

The frontend of Aave V3 app is open source. Each commit (ie each change to the code base) is published to IPFS (https://github.com/aave/interface/releases).

> Accessibility score: high

## Conclusion

Aave V3 is rated **Stage 1** because of the possibility to upgrade contracts with no limits on logic changes which in the worst scenario could lead to loss of funds and the upgrades are not sufficiently protected by a long enough exit window (>= 30 days) in combination with the on-chain governance.

The project could reach **Stage 2** if the on-chain governance (DAO) used a 30-day exit window instead of only 7 days.

# Technical Analysis

## Upgradeable Pool Contract and mutable reserve parameters

The center of an Aave V3 market is the liquidity pool contract called `Pool.sol`. Users can supply or borrow assets to this contract (`0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2`). Each supported asset that can be supplied and/or borrowed is attached to a reserve in this pool. A reserve specifies the market parameters for this asset (Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, Supply and Borrow Caps and the interest rate model). Additionally, each asset (ie reserve) can be enabled or disabled for borrowing, if disabled, the asset can only be supplied as collateral for borrowing other assets.

The `Pool` contract is completely upgradeable via the proxy-pattern. The right to update the pool contract via the proxy lies only with the on-chain governance (DAO).

Additionally, all parameters of the reserves are also fully mutable (parameters are mentioned in previous paragraph). The unrestricted ability to change these parameters also only lies with the on-chain DAO.

However, the control over market parameters, emergency freezing and pausing is additionally handed to multi-sigs and off-chain systems through a layered system which allows the governance to delegate certain permissions in a fine grained manner. The complete list of roles and role owners is shown in the list of roles.

![Reserve Parameter Control](../../../public/images/SIR_protocol_architecture.svg)

The diagram shows how Aave V3 manages control over Reserve parameters via a set of roles, stewards and councils. The illustration is not exhaustive, it is missing some roles and the detailed mechanism on how to create and delegate roles. The `PoolConfigurator` contract is the contract that has the permissions to change any reserve parameter. It mirrors the `Pool` functions that change reserve parameters and decorates them with access control to certain roles. For example pausing and freezing are assigned to `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role, while LTV or Supply and Borrow Caps are assigned to `RISK_ADMIN`. Steward contracts in turn are regular smart contracts that mirror a specific selection of the endpoints on the `PoolConfigurator` contract, but with guardrails for changing parameters and they also include rate limiting to certain functions. Councils which are regular multi-sigs are the permission owners of this steward functions and thus have only limited control over reserve parameters which prevents malicious behavior. The Governance itself can also update reserve parameters if the community wants to and has direct permissions on the `PoolConfigurator` endpoints via the role called `POOL_ADMIN`.

While `RISK_ADMIN` manages liquidity and market risk on a continuous basis my nuding supply and demand, in certain cases protection of user funds requires a halt of the system.
In the diagram above the `Emergency Guardian` is shown owning one role directly `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` and owning permissions on the `FreezeSteward` contract. This is a 5 of 9 multi-sig consisting various parties selected by the community.

## Governance

mention: Governance Level 1 Executor == Short

The on-chain governance system of Aave is multi-chain by design. The creation of proposals and voting on the proposals in permissionless. In this paragraph, the architecture and existing permissions are highlighted.

To get to the stage of voting and creating an on-chain proposal a few prior steps need to be passed to have sufficient probability of being accepted through an on-chain vote.

1. The proposal was discussed with the community and incorporated feedback
2. A temperature check on Snapshot is conducted. This vote is not binding, but it helps determining if sufficient support is within the community to move the proposal forward.
3. ARFC (Aave Request for Final Comments) where service provider and community members prepare the AIP
4. AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) which includes the contract payload submission
5. Actual on-chain vote
6. Execution

### AIP - Payload submission

Payload submission is technically permissionless. The payload is created by calling `createPayload` on the `PayloadsController` contract. The payload is an array of actions and each action contains information that specifies which contract to call with what data.

### Execution

Proposals are voted on in the `AaveGovernanceV3` contract. Once the proposal passes the function `executeProposal` on the `AaveGovernanceV3` allows to execute the approved proposal, which forwards the message to the `CrossChainController` (calling `forward`) that forwards the proposal to each chain where the proposal must be executed. If the proposal is also dedicated to the deployment on Ethereum, the call is forwarded to the `SameChainAdapter` that calls the function `receiveCrossChainMessage` on the `PayloadsController` contract, which queues the payload to be executed. The payload was previously created on the `PayloadsController` by calling `createPayload` which is needed to be referenced in the governance proposal. Anyone can call `executePayload` once sufficient time has passed (timelock). By calling `executePayload` on the `PayloadsController` `executeTransaction` on the `Executor Lvl1` contract will be triggered. A technical detail, if in this report it is mentioned that the governance owns the permission, it is actually (if we are very precise) this `Executor Lvl1` contract (as shown in the permission table) because community approved payloads will act from this contract.

In case of a malicious proposal the `Aave Governance V3 Guardian` can step in and stop the malicious proposal of being executed at the level of the `Payloads Controller`. Note this is can happen even if the proposal is supported by the majority of the community.

Additionally proposals on the `AaveGovernanceV3` contract (before proposal is executed) can be cancelled by BGD Labs with this [EOA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEAF6183bAb3eFD3bF856Ac5C058431C8592394d6). This places significant power to Bored Ghost Developing Labs as the governance can not update itself to remove this veto permission. Note this is can happen even if the proposal is supported by the majority of the community.

## Smart Contract Upgrade Flow

Many contracts of the Aave V3 system are directly upgradeable through a proxy pattern (see in the contract table for proxy keyword). The `Executor` contract would call the `upgradeTo` after deploying a new implementation contract. Additionally to the proxy upgrade pattern, Aave V3 has a contract called `PoolAddressesProvider` which serves as a registry of contracts. Through this contract upgrades can be made by deploying a new contract and switching the reference inside the `PoolAddressesProvider` as contracts in the Aave V3 system rely on `PoolAddressesProvider` as reference which contract they can call. Also the `PoolAddressesProvider` is owner of many crucial contracts as well.

Contracts that `PoolAddressesProvider` owns or can set are

- `Pool`
- `PoolConfigurator`
- `ACLManager`
- `Governance Executor`

Takeover over the `PoolAddressesProvider` contract has the most severe consequences as this contract is the owner of the Pool contract.

This can change the whole pool implementation logic and thus can affect deposits, collateral and unclaimed yield. The function on `PoolAddressesProvider` that can call this function is `setAddress` and this function is governed by the Aave Governance. Thus this change needs to pass governance vote, but as all governance votes it can be vetoed by the Aave Governance V3 Guardian to protect against malicious governance proposals that have passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PoolAddressesProvider                                                                                                                                                        |

They all got their own `PoolAddressesProvider` instance, and also their own `Pool`, `PoolConfigurator` and `ACLManager` and a bunch of other contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy)                                                                                                                                             |
| PoolAddressesProvider                                             | setAddress                             | Sets a new address in the `PoolAddressesProvider` for one of the following contracts `Pool`, `PoolConfigurator`, `PriceOracle`, `ACLManager`, `Executor` and `PriceOracleSentinel`. `PoolAddressesProvider` is the main registry of addresses part of or connected to the a specific market. Permission over this function is crucial as it allows to set relationships between contracts. Setting a new `PoolConfigurator` or `ACLManager` would allow an attacker to change Reserve Parameters at will which would result in the loss of funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy)                                                                                                                                             |

This allows to upgrade the proxy contracts, for example `Pool` or `PoolConfigurator`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy)                                                                                                                                             |

The admin of each role has the permission to allow new addresses to call functions on the `PoolConfigurator` contract. This function needs to be handled with care. Wrong addresses with `POOL_ADMIN` role can steal funds, by listing malicious aToken or debt Token implementations. Other roles can also lead to undesired and harmful actions, but are less privileged on the `PoolConfigurator` contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `DEFAULT_ADMIN` (ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy))                                                                                                                           |

The module then enters a post-slashing period during which new staking is temporarily disabled to prevent dilution of existing stakers' shares.

The StaticATokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StaticAToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StaticAToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StaticAToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets (aToken) and their corresponding StaticAToken addresses. StaticAToken are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism. Updating the implementation contract changes the token factory's logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ProxyAdmin (0xD3cF979e676265e4f6379749DECe4708B9A22476)                                                                                                                      |

The `Pool` contract calls the price source that is set with this function to determine the value of collateral and borrowed assets. If no price feed was registered or the pricefeed is not functioning for a requested asset, the call will revert. This disables `withdraw` and `borrow` calls on the `Pool` contract. The `Pool` or certain reserves in the `Pool` would then need to be paused to replace the oracle. Malicious price sources could be listed here but the DAO governance is in control of listing.                                                                                      | `POOL_ADMIN` OR `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN`                                                                                                                                        |

This function enforces boundaries to increase/decrease the cap only after 3 days at least have passed since the last cap update on a specific asset. This function calls `updateCaps` on `AaveV3ConfigEngine` which in turn calls `executeCapsUpdate` on `CapsEngine` which calls `setSupplyCap` and `setBorrowCap` on contract `PoolConfigurator`. The `PoolConfigurator` contract will then call `setConfiguration` on the `Pool` contract and enforcing this new cap on supply and borrow calls. If the supply cap is lower than current supply, no future deposits can be made until the cap is increased or the total amount of deposits is lower as the cap (same goes for borrow).                                                                                                                                                                               | RISK_COUNCIL                                                                                                                                                                 |

The following parameters are subject to change with this function: `optimalUsageRatio` (Optimal Point), `baseVariableBorrowRate`, `variableRateSlope1` and `variableRateSlope2`. A rate update is only possible after minDelay has passed after last update. A rate increase / decrease is only allowed by a magnitude of maxPercentChange. `optimalUsageRatio` by 3%, `baseVariableBorrowRate` by 0.5%, `variableRateSlope1` by 0.5% and `variableRateSlope2` by 5%. This function calls via an intermediate contract `setReserveInterestRateData` on `PoolConfigurator` which in turn calls the `Pool` contract to `setConfiguration`.

The following parameters are subject to change with this function: `ltv`, `liqThreshold`, `liqBonus` and `debtCeiling`. A collateral update is only possible after minDelay has passed after last update. The above mentioned parameters are only allowed to increase / decrease by a magnitude of maxPercentChange (`ltv` by 0.25%, `liqThreshold` by 0.25%, `liqBonus` by 0.5% and `debtCeiling` by 20% (relative)).

This report is concerned with Ethereum Mainnet, thus this contract represents a.DI on Ethereum. a.DI is a component in the Aave Protocol designed for cross-chain communication for DAO messages. It helps to minimise the risk of the underlying individual bridge providers and enabling Aave's governance decisions and protocol updates to propagate across different blockchain environments efficiently. Changing the Admin with the function `changeAdmin` gives a new address the power to specify the new implementation over cross-chain communication. False or hostile take over are fatal for the project's cross-chain dependencies as messages from and to Ethereum could be compromised signalling wrong votes to Ethereum or signalling false function calls to destination chains. | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                   |

At time of this writing CrossChainControllerUpgradeRev3 is the current version. The risk associated with this function is to deploy and upgrade to a new implementation that is compromised or less secure. If a vulnerability is introduced, cross-chain messages from and to Ethereum could signal wrong votes and decisions of the DAO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ProxyAdmin                                                                                                                                                                   |

By calling renounceOwnership the CrossChainController has no owner anymore. The previously mentioned functions are not callable anymore. As a result important parameters of CrossChainReceiver and CrossChainForwarder (send messages to other chains) cannot be changed anymore. While it mostly would affect efficiency, disabling or disallowing hacked bridges would not be possible, but since the system already abstracts single bridges to a consensus based abstracted cross-chain platform, single failures do not have a immediate effect.                                     | ACLAdmin / Executor_lvl1 (Proxy)                                                                                                                                             |

### Roles Permission inside `ACLManager`

ID refers to the 32-bytes value that is used within `AccessControl` by Open Zeppelin (inherited by `ACLManager`) to identify different roles.

RoleAdmin is currently the Governance Executor, but technically any address could become a role admin.
