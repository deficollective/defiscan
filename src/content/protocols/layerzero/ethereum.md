# Summary

LayerZero is a crosschain protocol that allows for the transfer of data and assets between chains. It is a permissionless protocol, meaning that any app can use the protocol for moving messages and tokens between chains. LayerZero relies on a Decentralized Validator Network (DVN) which validate transaction data that needs to move crosschain. LayerZero allows each protocol that integrates the crosschain protocol to configure their own security stack (DVNs) and executors.

# Protocol Analysis

![Architecture](../diagrams/layerZero-overview.png)

For moving messages and tokens across chains, protocol contracts post the message that has to be moved crosschain to the `EndpointV2` contract on the source chain alongside metadata which specifies the source and destination contract as well as endpoints. This `EndpointV2` contract on the source chain subsequently sends the data to a configured sending library that encodes the data and takes care of paying the verifiers (DVNs) and the Executor for verifying and executing the crosschain messages. After that, the `EndpointV2` contract emits an event (`PacketSent`) that has to be picked up by the configured and responsible DVNs.

Once picked up and verified, the DVNs attest the verification of the crosschain messages to the configured Receive Library contract (`ReceiveUln302.verify(...)`) on the destination chain. When the threshold is met, any account can call `commitVerification` on the destination chain to stage the message for execution.

In an additional step the executor executes the targeted message on the destination chain by calling `lzReceive`. If the designated executor does not execute the transaction on the destination chain, any user can step in and execute the transaction. Executing validated messages is permissionless. Users' transactions can thus not be censored once verified by the DVNs on the destination chain. `lzReceive` calls the target contract which is the OApp, OFT or custom contract.

# Rating

The risk of crosschain messaging lies in the execution of fraudulent messages on the destination chain and in censoring the transaction from moving crosschain. For example, if the bridged message is permissioned to mint tokens, a malicious DVN could mint tokens for themselves instead of the user's intended address on the destination chain. In the case of LayerZero, registering as a DVN is permissionless, thus also malicious DVNs can be registered to the LayerZero protocol.

The following sections examine the roles of LayerZero Labs, DVNs and integrating protocols and risks associated with each role.

## LayerZero Labs

LayerZero endpoints are not upgradeable. LayerZero Labs' role in the LayerZero protocol is to; 1) deploy Endpoints on new chains, 2) register new libraries to endpoints, 3) set default libraries and 4) change default DVNs. The existing endpoints and default configurations are not affected if LayerZero Labs ceases to exist.

The [OneSig](#security-council) multisig can change the default DVNs that verify crosschain messages with the function `setDefaultUlnConfigs`. If integrating protocols have no security stack / DVNs configured, their OApps/OFTs will fallback to the default DVN setup. In case LayerZero would setup a malicious DVN, this could lead to _loss of funds_.

Furthermore, the [OneSig](#security-council) multisig can change default libraries and the ownership over the `EndpointV2` contract. The send library (latest version is `SendUln302`) is used to encode the data that is sent to the destination chain. Additionally, the send library handles the payment of the verifiers (DVNs) and the executor for verifying and executing the crosschain messages. If integrating protocols have no libraries configured, they will use the default libraries. If the default send library is updated, integrating protocols that have not configured a library will be forced to use the new default library. If the default library is updated to a library that does not handle the payment of verifiers (DVNs) and the executor, it could lead to blocked crosschain transactions as DVNs are not incentivized to validate crosschain transactions.

Currently, the default DVNs for each path can be looked up at this page: https://layerzeroscan.com/tools/defaults

## DVNs

DVNs are trusted to verify the crosschain transaction data, if they choose to not verify, it would block and censor crosschain transactions.

Moreover, if the required DVNs collude (or if just a single DVN is configured) they could collectively verify a fraudulent transaction on the target chain. If a smart contract and protocol integrates LayerZero, it gives Layer Zero's endpoint permission to execute designated function like `lzReceice` upon verified and committed crosschain messages. The colluding DVNs can call this function with any viable parameters, mimicking a valid crosschain transaction for malicious purposes. If the integrating contract is an OFT, it would lead to unbacked minting of the token, as it is shown in our [blog article](/blog/layerzero-centralization-poc).

Risks from specific DVNs are not included into the score of this infrastructure, but are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for integrating protocols.

## Integrating Protocols (OApps, OFTs and custom integrations)

Protocols that integrate LayerZero for crosschain bridging are responsible to configure DVNs and Executors. The protocol specific configuration remains mutable at all times. If protocols choose not to configure the DVNs or libraries, the LayerZero protocol falls back to defaults that were set by the [OneSig](#security-council) multisig. If protocols rely on a limited and narrow DVN set and permissioned Executor set, it could result in censorship for users of the protocol. To be censorship resistant it is thus important to rely on a diverse set of DVNs. In case of censorship the protocol needs to update configuration and require new DVNs to relay the messages and token transfers or reimburse its users if tokens have been burnt/locked.

Moreover, if the protocol owner (DAO, multisig, EOA) is compromised and the attacker configures a malicious security stack (DVN), it could result in _loss of funds_ if the malicious DVN(s) approves and relays a fraudulent minting on the destination chain (see our [blog article](/blog/layerzero-centralization-poc)).

Lastly, the protocol owner can change the peer contract on the destination chain (`setPeer`) to a malicious contract if the contract is not upgradeable, or upgrade the peer contract if it is upgradeable. This could result in _loss of funds_ for users of the protocol.

It is essential that the integrating protocol guards permission over DVN configuration as malicious configuration can result in _loss of funds_ for users of the protocol at any time

Risks from integrating protocols are not included into the score of this infrastructure, but are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Conclusion

LayerZero protocol exposes centralized permissions on the default validator set that is used if the protocol owner does not configure a security stack. This results in a _High_ Centralization score.

Furthermore, integrating protocols need to be evaluated individually on their current configured security stack, the perissioned control on configuring the security stack and upgradeability of _OApps_ and _OFTs_ contracts.

> Overall score: High

# Reviewer Notes

- This review was limited to Endpoints and associated libraries deployed on Ethereum mainnet. We note that the findings should generalize to all chains according to LayerZero's documentation.
- LayerZero simplifies integration for protocols with the OApp and OFT contracts
- Each integrating protocol (OApp, OFT, or custom integration) sets up configuration for a specific path from chain A to chain B. The configuration from chain B to chain A is an separate configuration and as a consequence can deviate.
- Security stack, verifiers and DVNs are all synonymous.
- 0xfe9ab78ed4f9f3dbb168d9f5e5213d78605c9805 is unverified. It's the executor's implementation contract. The executor does not control or manage any user funds.
