# Summary

Cian Yield Layer is a yield aggregator that automates yield optimization — the process of automatically adjusting a yield strategy to maximize returns — by pooling user funds into vaults and deploying them to external protocols (lending, borrowing, staking, and restaking) to achieve the highest possible returns with minimal effort from the user. The Cian Protocol provides three products for users to get yield. The Cian Yield Layer, the Cian Strategy Mainnet Vaults and Cian Automation.

# Ratings

## Chain

Cian Yield Layer deploys yield strategies on various chains, this review focuses on the yield strategies on Ethereum mainnet. 

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability


The Cian Yield layer is fully upgradable allowing for the updates of all vaults (`YlFBTC`, `YlBTCLst`, `YlrsETH`, `YlstETH`) and strategy contracts e.g (`StrategyETHConverter`, `StrategyAAVEV3LIDO`). This can result in the loss of funds or unclaimed yield as well as lead to other changes in the expected performance of the protocol. 

The permission to upgrade the Cian Yield layer vaults (`YlstETH`, `YlBTCLst`, `YlrsETH`) and strategy contracts e.g (`StrategyAAVEV3LIDO`, `StrategyETHConverter`) is controlled by a 3/4 multisig for some vaults (`YlstETH`, `YlBTCLst`, `YlrsETH`) or an EOA in some e.g (VaultYieldETH, VaultYieldRSETH).  This makes the upgradeability score High.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

As a yield aggregator protocol, Cian sources its yield from multiple protocols. These are divided into three main categories depending on the yield source: staking yield, restaking yield, and lending yield sources. Examples include Lido Protocol for staking yield, Symbiotic, Mellow Protocol and Renzo Protocol for restaking yield, and Aave and Sparklend for lending yield sources. Dependence on multiple protocols that are at stage 0 on their decentralzation score increases dependecy failure and complexity. A failure on any of these protocols could result in loss or thefts of user fund or degraded protocol experience for users.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Withdrawals are not instant in the Cian Yield Layer, as users must first request withdrawals from the Yield layer vaults. The `redeemOperator` must then confirm each withdrawal request through the `Manager` contract. This `Manager` contract is controlled by an undisclosed multisig or an EOA that can arbitrarily withdraw funds and deny withdrawals from the vaults in cases of emergency, security breaches, or protocol insolvency. As a result, the exit window score is rated as High.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The Cian Yield Layer is only accessible via the https://cian.app front end. There are no self-hosted options for users to deploy, and if the front end goes down, there's no way for users to withdraw or deposit their assets or use the protocol. Therefore, the accessibility score is high.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The Cian Yiel Layer critical permissions are controlled by an EOA and undeclared multisig, thus earns a high upgradeability score. As in all vaults contract, users withdrawal must first be approved by vault owners, thus its Exit Window score is high.

With a dependence on multiple protocols for yield that are also **Stage 0** in their decentralization score and no robust governance or safety mechanism in case of dependency failure, gets a high in its Autonomy score. The protocol thus achieves a **Stage 0** decentralization score

The protocol could reach **Stage 0** by implementing the security council requirements for [Undeclared](#security-council) multisig account and for all yield layer vault contracts 1) Publishing and verfiying contract source code and their respective repositories. 2) Creating a governance system that controls all critical functions in the core contracts that are currently held by the all vault owners

# Reviewer's Notes

⚠️ During analysis, Several of the yield layer vault contracts and strategy contracts are unverified, are proxies and only their implementation address was referenced in the protocol docs. The yield layer vault contracts github repository is private and critical functions in the yield layer vaults are controlled by an undeclared 3/4 multisig which is not found in the protocol docs. Due to having unverified and undeclared multisig, this review will be in the Others section


# Protocol Analysis

## Cian Yield Layer

Users deposit their assets into the Vault contract. In return for their deposits, users receive corresponding LP tokens. These tokens represent their share of the assets held in the Vault. The allocation ratios for strategy funds within the Vault contract are set by the `Operator`, a multi-sig wallet. 

Based on the strategy fund allocation ratios set in the Vault contract, assets from the Vault are transferred to the corresponding strategy contracts. These contracts perform specific asset operations, such as investing, trading, or lending, based on the defined strategies to generate returns for the users. Each strategy operates according to its predefined rules and objectives. The `redeemOperator` contract is mainly used to record user withdrawal request data, handle the withdrawal operations and completes each withdrawal operation in a single transaction.

To withdraw funds from the vault, users must send a withdrawal request to the `redeemOperator` contract which also calls the `Manager` contract to batch execute user withdrawals and position adjustments after which a user recieves stETH. The `Operator` approves user withdrawals from the vault through the `Manager` contract.

# Dependencies

Cian-protocol uses chainlink oracles for in both their yield layer and strategy vaults to fetch prices onchain. Both strategy and Yield layer vaults allocate funds to external protocols like Aave, Lido, Renzo, and Sparklend either by staking, restaking, lending or borrowing to these protocols. These introduces a high dependency risk as there is no robust safety or governace mechanism in place in case of failure.

| StrategyPumpBTC (Implementation)          | enterProtocol                  | This function deposits funds into the underlying yield protocol. This is the core function for depositing assets to external protocols for yield.   | Manager (YlFBTC)               |
| VaultYieldFBTC (Proxy)                    | upgradeToAndCall               | Updates the implementation of the `VaultYieldFBTC` contract. Can only be triggered by the Owner itself. A malicious `Vault Owner` can replace `VaultYieldFBTC(Implementation)` and drain user funds.     | Vault Owner                    |

Note: The permissions for all Manager contracts (YlFBTC, YlBTCLst, YlrsETH, YlstETH) are similar; therefore, only Manager (YlstETH) is shown on the permissions page. RedeemOperator contracts of (YlrsETH, YlstETH) have the same functions; only RedeemOperator (YlstETH) is shown on the permissions page. 
The permissions for StrategyAAVEV3RsETH (Implementation) (YlstETH) and StrategyAAVEV3RsETH (Implementation) (YlrsETH) have similar functions; as a result, only one is shown on the permissions page. Likewise, StrategySolv (Implementation) (YlBTCLST) and StrategyPump (Implementation) have similar functions, so only StrategySolv is shown above.
