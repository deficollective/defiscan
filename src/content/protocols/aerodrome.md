# Summary

Aerodrome Finance is a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base's central liquidity hub, combining a powerful liquidity incentive engine, vote-lock governance model, and friendly user experience. Aerodrome inherits the latest features from Velodrome V2.

# Overview

## Chain

Aerodrome is deployed on the Base chain, an Ethereum L2 in Stage 0 according to L2BEAT.

> Chain score: H

## Upgradeability

To a large part the protocol is immutable. In particular, no permissions with a potential impact on user funds have been identified.

The remaining permissions are related to the protocol's rewards system and periphery contracts. These permissions are controlled by a number of multisigs including an _undeclared_ multisig.

Among these, the undeclared multisig has control over a whitelist of special voters with the ability to change the rewards distributed to LPs. Specifically, "regular" veNFT holders compete in weekly voting rounds to distribute a fixed amount of rewards, paid in the protocol's native token, AERO. Regular voters are able to signal their support for a specific _gauge_ which, after the conclusion of a voting round, receives and distributes rewards among the LPs of the linked pool. This public voting period is followed by a "private" voting window of 1 hour during which only the whitelisted veNFT holders are able to participate. As a result, these whitelisted veNFT holders, and by extension the undeclared multisig, are able to control the final vote outcome. The impact of this is classified as a potential material change of the expected performance including the loss of accrued yield (if public votes are overwritten by the whitelisted veNFTs).

The undeclared multisig further is the owner of various contracts, and the associated permissions, including the _FactoryRegistry_. This contract allows the undeclared multisig to (un-) approve _factory_ contracts within the protocol. User's swaps are routed through the pools created from the approved factories. Users are protected from malicious factories (and pools) through a user defined slippage tolerance which is enforced on all swaps on the router contract. On the other hand, only pools created from the _default_ factory are enabled for LP provisioning functions effectively protecting LPs in the protocol.

Another noteworthy permission in the protocol is the ability to _kill_ and _revive_ gauges and thereby stop, or enable, a gauge to receive and distribute rewards to LPs and voters. However, killing a gauge does not affect the rewards already distributed to LPs or voters and also does not affect the rewards, or any other aspect, of other gauges. This permission hence can not materially affect the protocol's expected performance.

> Upgradeability score: M

## Autonomy

Aerodrome does not have external dependencies 🎉

> Autonomy score: L

## Exit Window

Permissions are not protected by an exit window resulting in users not being able to withdraw funds in case of an unwanted update.

> Exit Window score: H

## Accessibility

Aerodrome provides multiple access points for users, including both centralized interfaces ([aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance), [alt.aerodrome.finance](https://alt.aerodrome.finance)) and decentralized interfaces on IPFS ([aero.drome.eth](https://aero.drome.eth), [aero.drome.eth.limo](https://aero.drome.eth.limo), [aero.drome.eth.link](https://aero.drome.eth.link)). This diversity in user interfaces ensures redundancy, allowing users to access the protocol even if one interface becomes unavailable.

If a factory is approved, the router allows swaps on the pools from this factory.

### Notes regarding the killing of a gauge

After each period, AERO tokens from the `Minter` contract flow into the `Voter` contract via calling `updatePeriod()`. Once the tokens are in the `Voter` contract, they flow according to the voting weight to each `Gauge` through calling `distribute()` on the `Voter` contract. Once the AERO tokens ended up in the different `Gauge` contracts, the users can claim their reward no matter of the living status of the `Gauge`. It's the function call `distribute()` that sends the tokens to the `Gauge` which reverts if the `Gauge` is killed. For rewards to be claimable for users the function calls `updatePeriod()` and `distribute()` need to occur in succession and the killing of the `Gauge` before either one of them results in yield not being available to the user. But, since both functions are public everyone, can call them. And thus during the first block of each period where `updatePeriod()` is callable, the permission owner that kills the `Gauge` needs to frontrun the transactions which are calling `updatePeriod()` and `distribute()`. This centralisation vector is thus not definitive and only probabilistic.

On the other hand, Voters earn a claim on yield proportional to their allocated votes when calling the `vote()` for a gauge on the `Voter` contract. Function `vote()` will revert if the respective gauge is killed, thus not crediting a claim on yield for the killed gauge. However, previous votes and the credited yield claims, before the gauge is killed, are not affected by this. Voters will thus still be able to claim their accumulated yield.
