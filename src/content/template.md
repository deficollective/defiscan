## Chain

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#chain for more guidance.

> Chain score: Low/Medium/High

## Upgradeability

In the upgradability section & risk we address bytecode upgrades and parameter changes that are permissioned.

We wrote a section explaining the Upgradeability Risk in our framework here: See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#upgradability

For some practical guidance follow this steps. It will help you in writing a nice report:

1. Run the [permission scanner](https://github.com/deficollective/permission-scanner)
2. Fill in all the permissioned functions in the table (`## Permissions`)
   - Remember: Each function with a permission needs to be considered when determining the risk on Upgradability
3. Get a mechanistic and precise understanding of each permissioned function
4. Assess impact for each function, look out for
   - loss/blocking of user funds
   - loss of unclaimed yield
   - change expected behavior significantly (blacklisting/kyc/fees/...)
5. Write the impact column based on your understanding
   - A good tipp when writing the impact column below, think of least 2,3 sentences:
   1. First sentence: what it does technically, e.g "It assigns a new address to the owner variable"
   2. Second: what is the impact within the system, e.g "The owner is permissioned to raise fees"
   3. Third: Imagine faulty or malicious action, e.g "The malicious owner could raise fees to 100%, redirecting all future yield.
6. Summarise and abstract away technical details in this section here (`## Upgradeability`)

> Upgradeability score: Low/Medium/High

## Autonomy

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#autonomy for more guidance.

> Autonomy score: Low/Medium/High

## Exit Window

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#exit-window for more guidance.

> Exit Window score: Low/Medium/High

## Accessibility

See http://defiscan.info/learn-more#accessibility for more guidance.

> Accessibility score: Low/Medium/High

## Conclusion

Some text in form of:

The xyz protocol achieves High centralization risk scores for its Upgradeability, Autonomy and Exit Window dimensions. It thus ranks Stage 0.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by ...

The project additionally could advance to Stage 2 if ...

# Reviewer's Notes

(Here, anything worth mentioning about what critical permissions you excluded from the scope or some elements that xyz protocol does in a unique way. If nothing seems relevant, just say that :)
