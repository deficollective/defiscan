We're thrilled to announce a new streamlined and consolidated all-in-one DeFiScan community review reward program, increased payouts, and clearer access to up-to-date protocol review bounties and availability.

We have run several incentivized review programs with various formats and payouts so far, and "users"—protocol reviewers—have reported that the multiplicity of the programs can be confusing, and we agree. 

Introducing DeFiScan's revamped incentivized review program: join us in our mission to achieve 90% DeFi TVL coverage by November 2025!

## Payout size

* The first Community Review program allowed to earn 500 LUSD per review. Community reviewers can now earn up to 2,000 LUSD, paid in stablecoins: [LUSD, on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xc40f949f8a4e094d1b49a23ea9241d289b7b2819).
* Payouts range from 1,000 to 2,000 LUSD, depending on the protocol's complexity. A long codebase, a large number of permissions, or a large number of external dependencies mean higher payouts.

## Protocols Available for Bounties

**Find available bounties directly on GitHub!** Any available protocol (not already worked on by someone else) is tagged "Available," along with the bounty payout amount ranging from 1,000 LUSD to 2,000.

Explore the up-to-date list of available protocols and payouts on the DeFiScan GitHub Pull Requests page: **[DeFiScan GitHub - Pull Requests](https://github.com/deficollective/defiscan/pull).**

We're launching with an initial batch of 8 bounties, with more to come.


## Review Submission

**Submitting a protocol review is an ongoing collaborative process.** It usually takes 2-4 weeks to complete and is verified by the team. The reviewer must be available for feedback and follow-up questions during this process. 

Submitting a review will require you to be available to the team for questions and feedback on **[the DeFiCollective Discord](https://discord.gg/zpDT7eeWv4)**. Once done, you can check GitHub to pick a protocol with a bounty available (see previous paragraph for details) and proceed:

1. **Claim Your Bounty:**Reach out on our Discord and let us know which bounty you want to work on. We will remove the available label and assign you the GitHub issue.
2. **Submit Your First Draft:** Fork the repository and write your draft review. Take the existing reviews as inspiration. Follow the review structure and create a protocol diagram (we will provide an Excalidraw canvas for that), **submit your draft review as a PR within 2 weeks** (failure to do so will result in us opening the bounty for others again)
3. **Collaborate on Feedback:** Ping the defiscan team on our Discord and work with the team on any updates necessary.
4. **Get Reward:** When final, we will merge your PR and make the payout.
