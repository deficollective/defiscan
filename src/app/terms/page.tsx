        <p>
          DeFiScan is an open platform providing information about the
          decentralization of third-party DeFi protocols ("<strong>Protocols</strong>"),
          including decentralization reviews ("<strong>Review(s)</strong>") as well as other
          content, features and tools (collectively "<strong>Content</strong>"). DeFiScan is
          provided as a freely available public good to further decentralization
          in DeFi by creating a common understanding and individualized
          measurement of decentralization in Protocols.
