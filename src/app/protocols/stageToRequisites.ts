    "Risks from critical permissions and dependencies are significantly reduced by: either revoking critical permissions, or establishing a Security Council to control such permissions, or enforcing an exit window of at least 7 days so users can withdraw funds in case of an unwanted protocol update. Critical risks from external dependencies are mitigated by the implementation of appropriate fallback mechanisms. Furthermore, the underlying chain cannot censor users’ transactions and a backup user interface exists guaranteeing access to user funds.",

    "Critical permissions have either been revoked or delegated to an on-chain governance system with ample time for users to exit in case of an unwanted protocol update. Risks from external dependencies have been further reduced such that users’ funds and unclaimed yield remain unaffected by a failure. In addition, different independent user interfaces and a fully decentralized underlying chain guarantee access to users’ funds at any time.",
