      <h2>Service Providers</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          The Collective may engage third party companies ("
          <strong>Service Providers</strong>") to facilitate the operation of
          our Website, assist in analyzing the usage of the Website, or perform
          Website-related services, such as the provision of IT infrastructure
          services. These third parties have access to the user's personal data
          only to the extent necessary to perform these tasks on behalf of the
          Collective.
        </p>

        <p>
          We particularly use the Services of Matomo, an{" "}

            open source

          web analytics platform (a privacy-friendly alternative to Google
          Analytics). A web analytics platform is used by a website owner in
          order to measure, collect, analyze and report visitors data for
          purposes of understanding and optimizing their website. Matomo is used
          to analyze the behavior of the website visitors to identify potential
          pitfalls; not found pages, search engine indexing issues, which
          contents are the most appreciated. Once the data is processed (number
          of visitors reaching a not found page, viewing only one pageâ€¦), Matomo
          is generating reports for website owners to take action, for example
          changing the layout of the pages, publishing some fresh content etc.
          We do not use cookies with Matomo. For more information on how Matomo
          works, please refer to their <a href="https://matomo.org">Website </a>

          If a third country transfer takes place and there is no adequacy
          decision or appropriate safeguards, it is possible and there is a risk
          that authorities in the third country (e.g. intelligence services) can
          gain access to the transferred data and that the enforceability of
          your data subject's rights cannot be guaranteed<strong>.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Data disclosure</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such
          action is necessary:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            To comply with a legal obligation (i.e., if required by law or in
            response to valid requests by public authorities, such as a court or
            government agency);
          </li>
          <li>
            To protect the security of the Website and defend our rights or
            property;
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with us;
          </li>
          <li>To defend ourselves against legal liability.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Data security</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          We take reasonable technical and organizational security measures that
          we deem appropriate to protect your stored data against manipulation,
          loss, or unauthorized third-party access. We continually aim to adapt
          our security measures to technological developments.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also take internal data privacy very seriously. Our team and the
          Service Providers that we retain are required to maintain secrecy and
          comply with applicable data protection legislation. In addition, they
          are granted access to personal data only insofar as this is necessary
          for them to carry out their respective tasks or mandate.
        </p>

        <p>
          The security of your personal data is important to us but remember
          that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage
          is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
          to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute
          security. We recommend using antivirus software, a firewall, and other
          similar software to safeguard your system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          You have the below data protection rights. To exercise these rights,
          you may contact the above address or send an e-mail to:
          hello@deficollective.org. Please note that we may ask you to verify
          your identity before responding to such requests.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Right of access: You have a right to request a copy of your personal
            data, which we will provide to you in an electronic form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to amendment: You have the right to ask us to correct our
            records if you believe they contain incorrect or incomplete
            information about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to withdraw consent: If you have provided your consent to the
            processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw
            your consent with effect for the future. Once we have received
            notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer
            process your information for the purpose(s) to which you initially
            consented unless there is another legal basis for processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to erasure: You have the right to request that we delete your
            personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for
            which it was collected or when it was unlawfully processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request
            the restriction of our processing of your personal data where you
            believe it to be inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or where we
            no longer need to process it for the initial purpose, but where we
            are not able to delete it due to a legal obligation or because you
            do not want us to delete it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to portability: You have the right to request that we transmit
            your personal data to another data controller in a standard format
            such as Excel, where this is data which you have provided to us and
            where we are processing it on the legal basis of your consent or to
            perform our contractual obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to object to processing: Where the legal basis for our
            processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest, you
            have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to
            your particular situation. We will abide by your request unless we
            have a compelling legal basis for the processing which overrides
            your interests or if we need to continue to process the personal
            data for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You have
            the right of appeal to a data protection supervisory authority if
            you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data
            protection law. The competent data protection authority in
            Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information
            Commissioner (
            <a href="http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">
              www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html
            </a>
            ). For the EU, you can exercise this right, for example, before a
            supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, your
            place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

      <h2>Links to third party apps or sites</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          Our website may contain links to websites or apps that are not
          operated by us. When you click on a third party link, you will be
          directed to that third party's website or app. We have no control
          over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies,
          or practices of any third party websites or services.
        </p>

        <p>
          We maintain online presences on social networks to, among other
          things, communicate with users and to provide information about our
          activities and our vision and mission. If you have an account on the
          same network, it is possible that your information and media made
          available there may be seen by us, for example, when we access your
          profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to contact you.
          The content communication via the social network and the processing of
          the content data is thereby subject to the responsibility of the
          social network. As soon as we transfer personal data into our own
          system, we are responsible for this independently. This is then done
          in order to carry out pre-contractual measures and to fulfill a
          contract. For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by
          the social networks under their own responsibility, please refer to
          their data protection declarations. Below is a list of social networks
          on which we operate an online presence:
