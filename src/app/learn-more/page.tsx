    "The maturity of DeFi technology progresses through several stages characterized by different degrees of decentralization. Upon deployment, DeFi protocols often expose critical risks from central dependencies and permissions controlled by centralized operators. As the protocol matures, these risks are eliminated e.g. through the introduction of fallback mechanisms, Security Councils and exit windows. To date, however, these stages have not been formalized resulting in a lack of transparency around the maturity and related risks of DeFi protocols.",
