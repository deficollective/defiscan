# ⭐️ DeFiScan Community Review Program

Are you deep in the trenches, knowing the protocols you use in and out? It’s time to put that knowledge to work, doing a service for the whole industry and getting paid for it!

After the successful release of [DeFiScan](https://defiscan.info) and the “How much De is in my Fi” competition last week during Devcon, we will now shift gears and focus on increasing coverage of the reviewed DeFi protocols. And how better to do this than through an incentivized community program with a total prize pool of 10,000 LUSD!

## TL;DR

- Key Information
- The total payout for community submitted protocol reviews is LUSD 10,000
- Anyone can submit reviews through a PR on the DeFiScan GitHub
- DeFi Collective members review and verify submissions
- Only PRs containing a complete and accurate review are merged and earn the prize of 500 LUSD
- Payouts are made in LUSD on Optimism
- Participants can submit more than one review
- The program ends as soon as LUSD 10,000 are paid out to community reviewers

## Scope

At this stage, and although all submissions are welcome, only the reviews of the following protocols (on the chains indicated in brackets) are eligible for the prize payout:

## Getting Started

The following steps outline the process of registering for and conducting a successful protocol review. Make sure you understand and follow this process:

1. Read the defiscan methodology and existing reviews to familiarize yourself with the expected submission process
2. Clone the permission-scanner repository from our GitHub
3. Fork the defiscan repository from our GitHub
4. Copy the review template and complete the information in the frontmatter with the details of the targeted DeFi protocol
5. Register your participation for the specific protocol by creating a draft PR with the review template on the defiscan repository
6. Complete the review within 2 weeks of registration (through step 5) by updating your PR with the full information
7. Ping the team in the DeFiScan channel on our GitHub
8. Assist the team in finalizing the review if any information is missing or incomplete
9. Once verified the team will merge your PR and coordinate for the payout - thank you!

## Rules

1. One PR per reviewer at once
   - Exception: If the same protocol is analysed on different chains
2. The review includes only one chain deployment (as we want to see all the specific params in the report, e.g. ownership entity can be different on different chains, and our reports look at a protocol on only one chain (see framework))
3. The reviewer can start after we confirmed the draft PR. The reviewer has 2 weeks time before the specific Protocol is open for other people to complete.
4. The schema for the PR name is `protocol name | chain | deadline (now+2weeks)`

## Successful Reviews

A review is considered successful if it follows the process outlined above and is ultimately merged to the main repository. In particular, this requires that:

- [ ] Registration of a protocol/chain by submitting a draft PR (not yet in review)
- [ ] Complete and submit final PR with accurate review within 2 weeks after registration
- [ ] Assist DeFi Collective team with final corrections and cleanups, merge PR within 1 week after final PR submission

> The prize of 500 LUSD is only awarded to successful reviews and paid out in LUSD on Optimism.
