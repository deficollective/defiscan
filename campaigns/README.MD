# ⭐️ DeFiScan Community Review Program

## Getting Started

The following steps outline the process of registering for and conducting a successful protocol review. Make sure you understand and follow this process:

1. Read the defiscan methodology and existing reviews to familiarize yourself with the expected submission process
2. Clone the permission-scanner repository from our GitHub
3. Fork the defiscan repository from our GitHub
4. Copy the review template and complete the information in the frontmatter with the details of the targeted DeFi protocol
5. Register your participation for the specific protocol by creating a draft PR with the review template on the defiscan repository
6. Complete the review within 2 weeks of registration (through step 5) by updating your PR with the full information
7. Ping the team in the DeFiScan channel on our GitHub
8. Assist the team in finalizing the review if any information is missing or incomplete
9. Once verified the team will merge your PR and coordinate for the payout - thank you!

## Rules

1. One PR per reviewer at once
   - Exception: If the same protocol is analysed on different chains
2. The review includes only one chain deployment (as we want to see all the specific params in the report, e.g. ownership entity can be different on different chains, and our reports look at a protocol on only one chain (see framework))
3. The reviewer can start after we confirmed the draft PR. The reviewer has 2 weeks time before the specific Protocol is open for other people to complete.
4. The schema for the PR name is `protocol name | chain | deadline (now+2weeks)`

## Successful Reviews

A review is considered successful if it follows the process outlined above and is ultimately merged to the main repository. In particular, this requires that:

- [ ] Registration of a protocol/chain by submitting a draft PR (not yet in review)
- [ ] Complete and submit final PR with accurate review within 2 weeks after registration
- [ ] Assist DeFi Collective team with final corrections and cleanups, merge PR within 1 week after final PR submission

> The prize of 500 LUSD is only awarded to successful reviews and paid out in LUSD on Optimism.
